The mandate was to audit the role of the credit rating agencies and ascertain whether there were any possible wrong-doings in rating IL&FS group companies during 2008-2018.\\n\\nSeveral e-mails between the erstwhile management and the representatives of credit rating agencies during the specified period have been analysed in the audit.\\n\\nCARE, ICRA, India Ratings and Brickwork were the main rating agencies for group companies IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL), IL&FS Financial Services IFIN and IL&FS during the period. From 2016, Brickwork was also introduced for IFIN and ITNL. It replaced Crisil for ITNL.\\n\\nGrant Thornton found multiple emails in the period between September 2012 and August 2016, where it appeared that Ramesh Bawa, former CEO of IFIN, facilitated purchase of a villa for the wife of Ambreesh Srivastava (Head of Financial Institutions—South and Southeast Asia, Fitch Ratings) and also helped them obtain a discount.\\n\\nFurther, Bawa requested Ajay Chandra (MD of Unitech Limited) to personally get involved and resolve the issue that Srivastava's wife was facing with regards to interest charged on delayed payments for the villa.\\n\\nThe audit has flagged that potentials favours were obtained by Srivastava from Bawa, thus raising question over his independence in the rating obtained from Fitch as well as India Ratings.\\n\\nAnother email trail from April 2015 showed D Ravishankar (Founder and Director, Brickwork Ratings) thanking Arun Saha (who was Joint Director of IFIN at that time) for arranging tickets for a football match of Real Madrid in Madrid, Spain, in the IL&FS corporate box along with his son.\\n\\nThis email suggested potential favours which are arranged for key officials of a credit rating agency by one of the former IL&FS management personnel.\\n\\nIn case of ICRA, the audit found an email from February 2008, which was sent by Meenakshi Kanagat (Manager in IL&FS Limited) to Ravi Parthasarthy (former chairman of IL&FS) indicating donation of Rs 25 lakh to be given to Sameeksha Trust.\\n\\nGrant Thornton found that D N Ghosh was a Managing Trustee of Sameeksha Trust and also a former chairman of ICRA Limited.\\n\\nThe emails were also traced about Saha asking Sujoy Das (Chief Risk Officer of IL&FS group) for arranging a favourite Fitbit watch for Rajesh Mokashi (Managing Director of CARE).\\n\\nThe interim report also indicated that IL&FS personnel were aware of the specific interests of the key officials of credit rating agencies.\\n\\nThe audit has also traced emails about IL&FS providing gifts in the form of shirts to various key managerial personnel of IL&FS as well as Ambreesh Srivastava (of Fitch Ratings).\\n\\nBesides, Saha had also instructed his staff to distribute gifts, including Gulmeher coasters, to key personnel of various rating agencies during Diwali.\"}, {'title': 'Better career prospects, sense of fulfilment attract expats to India: HSBC Survey', 'body': 'New Delhi: India has emerged as a popular destination for expats as working in the country boosts their careers and provides enhanced salary and sense of fulfilment, says an HSBC survey.\\n\\nThe survey was conducted on 18,059 expats from 163 markets.\\n\\nAround 48 percent of overseas professionals noticed the benefits of working in India, having achieved a greater sense of fulfilment after relocating, as compared to the global average of 42 percent.\\n\\nOver 29 percent of international professionals said they have been promoted more rapidly as a result of relocating to India.

Possibly the most glaring of those is a massive shortage of administrators in government. The scale of the problem was flagged in the Lok Sabha on July 4 by Union minister for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar when he informed the House that almost 700,000 government posts were vacant as of March 2018, 260,000 of them in the Indian Railways alone.\\n\\nOne way of filling the vacancies is \\'lateral entry\\', bypassing the standard route of inducting civil servants via the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and recruiting directly from the private sector. On this count, in June this year, Dr C. Chandramouli, secretary of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), asked officials to prepare a proposal for the induction of private sector experts to the deputy secretary and director level positions in the IAS. According to sources, a total of 40 such specialist officers are likely to be appointed laterally. Even the Niti Aayog, the central government think-tank, might do the same for deputy secretary and joint secretary level positions. \\'Today, the complexity of the economy means that policymaking is a highly specialised activity. Therefore, it is essential that specialists be inducted into the system. Lateral entry will also have the beneficial side effect of bringing competition to the established career bureaucracy,\\' notes a draft report by the Niti Aayog on civil services reform.\\n\\nNew dog, old tricks\\n\\nThat being said, lateral entry into the administrative services is not a new idea. It is a widely applied practice, with the governments of the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand as well as several members of the European Union doing the same. Even in India, the idea was proposed as early as 2001, when the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) report of the civil services examination review committee, chaired by noted economist Yoginder Alagh, recommended lateral entry into the middle and top tiers of the bureaucracy. Then, in 2005, the second Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC), chaired by Veerappa Moily, recommended that an institutionalised, transparent process be established for lateral entry into central and state government administrative positions. The year after that, the Justice B.N. Srikrishna-headed sixth central pay commission report reiterated the recommendation, stating that lateral entry could also \\'ensure entry and retention of talent in the civil services\\'.\\n\\nGraphics by Tanmoy Chakraborty; Source: Seventh Central Pay Commission Report\\n\\nThere is also notable precedent for highly qualified professionals being laterally inducted into the top echelons of administration. The list includes heavyweights such as former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Raghuram Rajan, Urjit Patel, Arvind Panagariya, Arvind Subramanian and Nandan Nilekani, among several others.\\n\\nHowever, resistance from the strong IAS lobby and sheer institutional inertia has so far led to these recommendations remaining words on paper, or being mired in administrative delays. The NDA government had taken up this issue in June last year, recommending the induction of private sector professionals to senior joint secretary level positions in the IAS. In April this year, the UPSC selected nine professionals for these vacant posts. Despite the fact that the list includes IIT and IIM alumni, Rhodes scholars and graduates of institutes as renowned as Oxford, none of them has been inducted as yet.\\n\\nWhile these proposals have been mooted in the past, the Modi government\\'s official policy decision to employ lateral entry on a large scale is an ambitious, out-of-the-box attempt to solve the problem. Experts say this move was triggered by the Niti Aayog\\'s 2017 report, which underlined the urgent need to induct specialists into the administrative systems. It was also presented as a solution to the dire shortage of senior bureaucrats, especially in the IAS, which has only 5,004 such officers, against an authorised strength of 6,500. This shortage also affects other government sectors, including in the police and judiciary. It is especially acute in the Hindi heartland states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Rajasthan. In India\\'s most populous state, UP, the overall shortage is 43 per cent, according to a 2016 study.\\n\\nThe debate over lateral entry\\n\\nThose who advocate \\'minimum government\\' often describe the bureaucracy as \\'bloated\\', arguing that vacancies do not need to be filled because the administrative services are already overstaffed. However, public administration experts disagree, arguing that the Indian civil services are facing an acute shortage of skilled workers and domain experts. This disagreement is a big reason for the slow progress in adopting lateral entry as a method of filling government posts. Another point of contention is the role of the bureaucracy in India\\'s successes.\\n\\nSource: DoPT minister Jitendra Singh’s written reply to the Lok Sabha on March 22, 2018.\\n\\nSabeer Bhatia, the founder of Hotmail-who is in favour of lateral entry-argues that India has had some spectacular, nation-transforming successes that owe nothing to the bureaucracy. Bhatia cites the example of the Green Revolution, India\\'s space and atomic energy programmes, the rollout of Aadhaar and the Unified Payments Interface, telecom deregulation and the liberalisation of the financial sector, among others. \"Take the four most innovative and, therefore, lucrative industries today,\" he continues. \"These include semiconductors, avionics, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. What value has the Indian bureaucracy added to these sectors? Zero. The global semiconductor industry, for example, has a healthy percentage of Indians in leadership positions-and yet, India\\'s national contribution remains nil.\" The Indian government cannot contribute to such specialised (and remunerative) sectors, he argues, without experts from the global market being brought into leadership positions in the bureaucracy-which depends on the adoption of lateral entry.\\n\\nSource: Seventh Central Pay Commission Report\\n\\nShailaja Chandra, a former secretary in the government, takes the argument further, saying in specialised areas \"like finance, accounts, taxation, legal affairs, disinvestment, and budgeting, procurement and revenue collection\" lateral entry is likely to be effective. \"In such areas, mid-level lateral entrants can bring skills that IAS officers or Group A officers do not possess.\" However, she also notes that \"the IAS, as a service, remains indispensable to the process of government. No lateral inductees can ever replace it,\" cautioning that the process must not \"deteriorate into a revolving door between the government and the private sector, audit and chartered accountancy firms and think-tanks set up by industry.\"\\n\\nHowever, many civil servants disagree hotly with the wisdom of lateral inductions, arguing that the in-field experience and knowledge of government processes, administrative hurdles and workarounds that IAS officers bring to the table are a form of expertise that private sector professionals cannot possibly have. \"External talent cannot bridge the gap between policymaking and ground-level implementation the way career civil servants can,\" says a chief secretary, requesting anonymity. Critics from within the bureaucracy also allege that lateral entry is unconstitutional, contrary to the public good and is likely to bypass the system of quotas meant to ensure that scheduled castes and scheduled tribes have appropriate levels of representation. \"This move to induct private talent into the government, [bypassing] reservations, is illegal and can be challenged both in court and in Parliament,\" says former BJP MP and Indian Revenue Service officer Udit Raj (who switched to the Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha election). And there are other protests against the NDA government\\'s new policy direction. Congress leader Veerappa Moily, for instance, who had himself recommended lateral entry to the bureaucracy as chairman of the second ARC report, says, \"The BJP government\\'s move on lateral recruitment is part of its roadmap to saffronise the civil services.\"\\n\\nTo permit or not to permit\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to argue with the fact that the Indian administrative ecosystem is heavily staffed by generalists, and that specialists are becoming increasingly important in several functions of government. For instance, specialisations like big-data analytics are crucial to good governance-for example, it does not matter how wide the net of Aadhaar is spread if the babus responsible for those database cannot come to grips with it. Domain expertise is no longer a bonus-it is a requirement.\\n\\nThe colonial-style bureaucracy India still labours under, the so-called \\'steel fortress\\', is a major impediment to progress. In a 2016 study conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, titled \\'The IAS Meets Big Data\\', the authors write: \\'India\\'s economy has grown rapidly in recent years, but the country\\'s bureaucratic quality is widely perceived to be either stagnant or in decline\\', and that \\'the IAS is hamstrung by political interference and outdated personnel procedures, [has] a mixed record on policy implementation, and is in need of urgent reform.\"\\n\\nAgriculture secretary and CEO of National Rainfed Authority, Ashok Dalwai, says: \"IAS officers must compete and collaborate with external specialists, instead of complaining about them or criticising them. Reform must disrupt and change the hierarchical culture of the IAS.\"\\n\\nIndia\\'s bureaucracy has long been criticised for being obstructionist, and that it has often been an impediment to implementing even well-intended policy initiatives. Besides, bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome, slow, inefficient and trapped in a file-pushing culture that encourages corrution. Critics point out that a bureaucracy manned by generalists is like a slow-moving bullock cart in an era when information travels at the speed of light. Ths status quoists in the bureaucracy see red. It is disquieting, after all, for an entrenched force to see its \\'steel fortress\\'-even a crumbling one-- being stormed by plebeians.'}, {'title': 'An Ode To Ugliness| Fashion', 'body': 'Beauty is nothing, beauty won\\'t stay. You don\\'t know how lucky you are to be ugly, because if people like you, you know it\\'s for something else.\" -- Charles Bukowski, Tales of Ordinary Madness\\n\\nA recurring dream about a classical pianist once became the inspiration for Kolkata-based fashion designer Kallol Datta\\'s collection, Untitled. In this dream, the pianist, at the peak of his career, develops a hump one night and finds his right arm swelling up grotesquely. Unable to perform any more, he ends up at a circus freak show where people come to gawk at him and revel in his misery. The absurdist mutilations of the pianist\\'s body eventually made it into Datta\\'s creations. It took a while for the \\'fashionable\\' crowd to understand Datta\\'s rebellion. \"What spaceship is this guy on?\" That was their initial reaction to his fantasies. However, Datta\\'s fashion was clearly reflecting a trend, gathering steam globally. A trend that celebrates the \"ugly\".\\n\\nAnother fashion label with shock value is HUEMN. At the Lotus Make-up India Fashion Week Autumn/ Winter 2019 in Delhi, when Pranav Mishra, co-creator of HUEMN, took a bow, the logo on his T-shirt read \"Don\\'t F**k with Me\". HUEMN, launched in 2012, has worked with trans models, such as Taksh Sharma, and celebrates gender fluidity, often putting provocative slogans on its clothes. HUEMN and Datta are among a group of labels and designers leading the charge against Indian fashion\\'s decorative ensembles as part of a trend that has loosely come to be known the world over as \"ugly fashion\".\\n\\nWhat is ugly fashion?\\n\\nUgly fashion, especially as it has come to be interpreted in India, is hard to define. It is, at its core, a celebration of what is normally perceived as ugly, anguished, misshapen and gender agnostic. It attacks the root of the pervasive idea of beauty created by fashion editors whose reductive approach to fashion has left it bereft of everything except glamour. It rejects the notion of the body as an emblem of human accomplishment. Instead, it pushes the boundaries of the physical and the moral. Especially in the age of Instagram and YouTube, ugly seems to be the only way to stand out among perfection.\\n\\nLike most trends in Indian fashion, the ugly trend too has trickled down from the West. The \"ugly\" as an inspiration to create was, perhaps, best explained by Belgian fashion designer Dries Van Noten in a rare appearance at the French institute Alliance Française\\'s Fashion Talks series in 2012, New York. \"I\\'m more inspired by things I don\\'t like.... Nothing is as boring as something beautiful. I prefer ugly things, things which are surprising,\" he said. It was in that year that ugly fashion took on a definitive shape on the international runways with the debut of pool slides by Christopher Kane. It began to gain momentum with Céline\\'s fur-lined Birkenstock which followed later in the year. Croc couture has since become common, with even Balenciaga offering a take on the clog in 2017.\\n\\nIn India, \"ugly fashion\" also, perhaps, rose as a reaction to the over-ornamental bridal clothes that dominate Indian designer labels. In 2019, we are still peddling embroidered flowers and kitsch at international fashion events.\\n\\nShapeless clothing, chunky heels and puffers are the signposts of fashion\\'s next frontier. Trending, along with dad sneakers, are ugly floral dresses, ugly work vests, ugly sweaters, ugly jackets and high-waisted mom jeans. It is a trend designed to agitate or even irritate the world, as Datta puts it. In India, the ugly fashion trend evolved from another design aesthetic that gained traction around 2013-the \"norm-core\". A portmanteau of \"normal\" and \"hardcore\", it was initially meant to define fashion that enabled one to blend in, but became more about standing out in the designer-dictated fashion crowd.\\n\\nThe norm-core trend In India can be seen in the collections of Rina Singh, Anavila and Buna Studio, among others. It\\'s about getting noticed while not being noticeable. It also encourages sustainability in fashion.\\n\\nApart from norm-core, androgynous clothing too has influenced what Indian designers call ugly, with some of them, such as Sumiran Kabir Sharma\\'s Anaam, producing unflattering, form-- defying silhouettes and actively rejecting beauty norms set by Bollywood.\\n\\nThe anti-designer: A silk crab dress paired with a paper overlay from the \\'Volume 1, Issue 2\\', 2018 collection by Kallol Datta (inset). The overlay almost resembles a garbage bag, going against the industry norms of a \"pretty\" dress. (Photo: Subir Halder)\\n\\nUgly fashion in India\\n\\nIn India, the ugly fashion trend is even more significant because of its engagement with social and political issues that go beyond beauty and high fashion.\\n\\nTwo years after Kane\\'s pool slides, Ujjawal Dubey of Antar-Agni debuted in 2014 with his collection titled \\'No Longer the Hunted\\', featuring silhouettes for men inspired by the barren landscape of Afghanistan. For his Spring/ Summer 2019 collection, \\'Into the Light\\', in contrast, he used bright colours, gender fluid silhouettes and had his male models in bright reds and yellows, pairing multi-layered kurtas with long skirts. \"This \\'ugly\\' offers a lot of creativity,\" he says. \"The clothes are designed to agitate. Beauty and ugliness are relative terms. There must be freedom from the imposition of perceived beauty.\"\\n\\nIn October 2018, Sohaya Misra of Chola the Label had drag queens walk the ramp for her collection, \\'Bye Felicia\\'. Along with being a great marketing gimmick, it also bid farewell to the restrictive and the irrelevant.\\n\\nSudheer Rajbhar\\n\\nFor designer Sudheer Rajbhar of Chamar Studio, fashion is a way to restore the dignity of a word that took on pejorative connotations because of India\\'s caste politics. His label offers utilitarian, sustainable bags, belts with criss-cross stitches, the trademark of Indian cobblers who typically belong to lower castes, and silver steel buttons made in the small tenements of Dharavi. For a forthcoming project, Rajbhar, 32, has collaborated with 75 international and Indian designers to give the marginalised castes a luxury tag. The project is being supported by Ensemble, a high-end fashion retail chain. The bags from this collection, curated by Farah Siddique, will be sold at Ensemble, pop-ups and most high-end stores. In his first collection, too, titled, \\'Bombay Black\\', he had used recycled rubber tyres to make the batwa (wallet), basta (backpack) and bora (large tote), retailing between Rs 600 and Rs 6,000. Plus, earlier this year, he launched Project Blue Collar, an ode to Bhim Rao Ambedkar who had assigned the colour blue to the cause of Dalit empowerment. The project was launched, fittingly, on May 1, celebrated internationally as International Workers Day.\\n\\nBarren splendour: Sumiran Kabir Sharma in unisex misshapen, draped pants paired with a three zipper wool jacket whose shape and wearability can be changed simply with the use of the various zippers. The garments are from his 2018 collection, aptly titled, Beherupiyaa\\'.\\n\\nWhile Rajbhar takes on caste, Datta took on religion in his 2019 collection, called \\'Volume 2 Issue 1\\', challenging the pre-conceived notions that accompany the donning of religious garments and the resulting exclusion from \"access to economic activities\".\\n\\n\"Perhaps around the time the ugly fashion trend rolled around, contemporary designers in India were still re-imagining modern Indian fashion,\" says Gursi Singh of Delhi-Based Lovebirds Design. \"The ugly trend helped shape certain elements of the androgynous, norm-core or minimalist contemporary brands we see today. In that sense, Indian contemporary fashion is an anti-fashion movement in itself.\"\\n\\nAnaam\\'s Sharma, a quintessential small-town boy now based in Delhi, debuted in 2017 with a collection inspired by the \"women warriors of Sonagachi\", which opened at the Lakmé Fashion Week winter/ festive 2017\\'s Gen Next show. For this, he clothed his models in austere drapes in suiting fabric with tall hats and shoes with words like bigotry, hunger, poverty, homophobia painted on them. The collection was a tribute to the battle-hardened sex workers-of all shapes, sizes, ethnicities, age and gender-he saw when a taxi he was in took a detour through Sonagachi, a red light district in Kolkata. To him, it almost looked like a war zone.\\n\\nHUEMN, on its part, engages with society too. A sweatshirt, from their \\'Tribute to Kashmir\\' collection, features the back of a woman in a hijab walking down an alley in what seems like downtown Srinagar. The city is on fire around her, the sequins and stones making up the flames. With this piece of ugly fashion, Mishra took an ugly truth and made it visible.\\n\\nUgly CHIC Bombay Black’, the first collection by Sudheer Rajbhar, was an ode to the city’s vast slums always covered in black and blue tarpaulin. It was his way of representing the marginalised.\\n\\nBut is it a rebellion?\\n\\n\"Currently designers are making superficial adjustments to their aesthetic and still pandering to the western gaze,\" says Datta. \"It isn\\'t subversive clothing because it fails to go beyond a graphic on a T-shirt.\" He feels consumers have become vocal about the clothes available to them and the fashion industry is finally being held accountable to the current social standards. \"As with every sector, fashion is rife with misogyny, racism and homophobia,\" he adds. Interesting conversations are taking place on social media about one\\'s right to choose versus one\\'s right to choose under oppressive conditions. \"Clothing is immersed deep in these very conversations since it makes us immediate markers of our communities. To see minimal involvement by fashion designers in these conversations is appalling,\" says Datta.\\n\\nSunil Sethi, president of the Fashion Design Council of India, has been challenging the status quo by promoting designers like HUEMN. He feels that India catches the tail of trends that emerge in the West. \"There are few who are brave enough to be so experimental,\" he says, adding that many designers tend to label ugly fashion as \\'alternative fashion\\' in India. \"The issue is our young generation might be rebelling in their minds but when it comes to fashion, they are still reluctant to experiment.\" The one example, he feels, which sort of had a trickledown effect was distressed jeans.\\n\\nEveryday beauty: Ujjawal Dubey of Antar-Agni in a silhouette from his winter/ festive 2018 collection Begin’, inspired by the human emotions that tend to break us away and still keep us rooted.\\n\\nThe Indian fashion scene has been brutal to designers who attempted to go against the tide, like the Gothic and punk fashion heralded by Nitin Bal Chauhan or Datta. \"It is because the commercial market is not accepting this fashion at all. We are still a conservative market,\" says Sethi.\\n\\n\"It may seem like the big guns and bright minds of fashion all want to be seen as liberal socialists, but at heart they\\'re all capitalists,\" says Datta. But capitalist or not, to be ugly consciously is to be brave in times of fashion clones. While there have been plenty of collections over the past few years with shock value, 2018 marked the definitive rise of ugly fashion internationally, perhaps also as a broader reaction to the #MeToo movement, according to fashion psychologists. Closer home, Datta feels that designer engagements with movements like \\'time\\'s up\\' and #MeToo continue to be myopic because they \"do not go beyond a pin or a wristband\". Anaam\\'s Sharma disagrees and says that new trends signal a rise in the \"renegade spirit of women who are championing the cause of ugly clothes as a protest to show they are no longer prisoners of validation.\" In fact, he would like to objectify men as an act of rebellion, he adds.\\n\\nSharma thinks of ugly fashion as a revolt or a rebellion. The designer defied India\\'s current obsession with handloom in his collection called \\'Janaza\\' last year and blurred gender lines. He feels that the main motive of the trend is to get the attention and portray the shift in the perception of dressing. \"It is all about identification. I am inspired by rag-pickers who would be considered ugly. Ugly could be beautiful.\"'}, {'title': 'Breathing life back into Mumbai’s fountains', 'body': 'In July 1871, the Scientific American magazine carried a report on a newly built fountain, calling it “one of those rare works which captivate the artistic eye\". The magazine even ran an illustration of the fountain on its cover page and described it in great detail—the fan-like jets of water that fall into shells, the four dolphins, the bronze heads of lions and panthers. It described the central jet of water that “wells up like a natural spring, the sound of which must be refreshing in a hot climate like that of Bombay\".\\n\\nThe Frere Fountain in Mumbai’s Fort area was the largest of its kind in India and won the admiration of New York’s elegant circles. It was built in 1864 by the Agri–Horticultural Society of Western India to honour the then governor, Sir Bartle Frere. In the decades that followed, it would be renamed Flora Fountain, after the Roman goddess poised at the top. It would become the site of a tragic incident in 1955, when 15 protesters were killed in police firing during a demonstration for the Samyukta Maharashtra movement. Six years later, a memorial was built to commemorate those who died during the movement and the square was renamed Hutatma Chowk (Martyr’s Square). Around 2007, the water jets would work intermittently, and Flora Fountain was relegated to the same fate as many other colonial era structures in Mumbai—too graceful to be ignored but too cumbersome to maintain.\\n\\nThis January, Flora Fountain was back in action. Restoration architect Vikas Dilawari was commissioned by the Brihanmumbai municipal corporation (BMC) to revive the fountain—a job that took him and his team two-and-a-half years. Dilawari has worked on three more fountains in the vicinity: the Wellington Fountain, the Bomanjee Hormarjee Wadia Clock Tower and Fountain, and the Muljee Jetha Fountain.\\n\\nRestoration architect Vikas Dilawari.\\n\\nDilawari meets us one afternoon at Flora Fountain during a brief, sunny respite from the rains. The architect has won 16 Unesco Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation, including 14 for Mumbai projects. “I wanted to go beyond just restoring the fountains; I wanted to see how I could get the water fittings to function again. Having fixed the smaller fountains first, that experience gave me and my firm a lot of confidence to work on Flora Fountain,\" he says.\\n\\nAs he darts through criss-crossing lanes to take us to the other fountains, it is evident that Mumbai is his turf. It has several structures—public, commercial and residential—that still stand thanks to Dilawari. These include the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, the Royal Bombay Yacht Club, the Rajabhai Clock Tower and the stained glass of Mumbai University’s Library Building. The fountains are among his more recent projects.\\n\\nThe first fountain restored by Dilawari is located at the convergence of six roads, at a roundabout used by nearly every visitor to Colaba. The Wellington Fountain was built by public subscription in 1865, at the height of the British empire. It was a tribute to Sir Arthur Wellesley, the duke of Wellington, adorned with inscriptions on his many victories, including one against the Marathas. The fountain has surprisingly survived the nativist decolonization mission to destroy or shift colonial monuments. What it didn’t survive, however, were the contractors who painted over the original marble, covering the fine bas-reliefs. The grand tribute had turned into a dowdy water spout.\\n\\nDilawari finished restoring the Wellington Fountain in 2017 and it earned a special mention in the Unesco Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation that year. “We had to first undo old mistakes,\" he says. Dilawari called in conservators from the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), Mumbai, to carefully scrape the layers of paint off the bas-reliefs, a task that took them two months. Among the fountains, Wellington was also the easiest and the least expensive to restore, for it was functional. Funded by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the restoration cost around ₹10 lakh.\\n\\nThe striking Muljee Jetha Fountain was built in 1894 and dedicated to the memory of Dharamsee Muljee, who died at the age of 15. Photographs by Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint\\n\\nThis was not the case with the Muljee Jetha Fountain, completed in 1894. There is a heartbreaking tale behind the creation of the fountain. It was built as a memorial to a young boy named Dharamsee Muljee, who died at the age of 15. His father, Ruttonsee, dedicated the fountain to him and offered it to the public, providing drinking water for both people and animals.\\n\\nSince it had fallen out of use, Dilawari had to reactivate the fountain’s plumbing system. “The fountain now functions for a few hours every morning and evening. Care is taken in using the pipes or else they will wear out soon,\" he says. At the top of the fountain is a statue of young Dharamsee holding a book and gazing hopefully at the horizon. “I think it’s actually lovelier than Flora Fountain,\" says Dilawari.\\n\\nThe Muljee Jetha Fountain was designed by Frederick William Stevens, who also designed the sprawling Gothic Revivalist Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST). Stevens put 52 spouts on the Indo-Saracenic fountain, and, instead of CST’s menacing gargoyles, added alligators, elephants, cows and iguanas.\\n\\nEach of the fountains that are spread across south Mumbai have unique designs, says Dilawari. The Bomanjee Hormarjee Wadia Clock Tower and Fountain has several elements of Persian architecture, in keeping with the heritage of the Parsi sheriff it was built in honour of. “Lots of things were considered while building fountains—a popular area had to be chosen, it had to be built at a square or junction of roads, its architectural style was decided on the basis of what the sponsor wanted, the quality and quantity of stones depended also on the sponsor money,\" says Dilawari.\\n\\nWhen Dilawari set out to work on Flora Fountain, he discovered that Flora’s head had been severed and joined again. “Likewise, the hands and fingers of the other statues at the base of the fountain had been replaced by concrete limbs. Because the concrete was painted white, the statue had to be painted white; and because the statue was white, the whole fountain had to be painted white,\" he says. After restoration, the fountain’s original beige Portland stone glows with an understated elegance.\\n\\nAll great cities allow themselves to be read in many ways. That is surely the case with Mumbai. You can map it through its railway lines, its bus routes, its Gothic structures, and also through its fountains.\\n\\nHistorian Shekhar Krishnan says Mumbai had over 100 ornate fountains, cattle troughs and pyaus or water dispensers. Some of these were attached to places of worship but all were public structures, registered with the civic body. This water infrastructure is hard to sustain today, owing not just to negligence but also a growing water crisis. Flora Fountain requires 15,000 litres of water per week, according to Dilawari, though its tank capacity is 45,000 litres. The water comes from a nearby borewell and cannot be treated as chemicals could endanger the lives of the birds that drink from the fountain. All this means Flora Fountain gathers moss often and needs regular maintenance—something the BMC is looking into.\\n\\nThe purpose of a fountain in contemporary urban design can be debated. But Dilawari is clear that it is one of the first impressions you get of a city. “Fountains tell you that you are in a beautiful city,\" he says. Moreover, fountains are usually erected as memorials and tributes. “It was a philanthropic gesture on the part of citizens. They used to provide fountains as charity rather than the cement benches you see today,\" adds Dilawari.\\n\\n“It is not enough to restore the structure alone but also enhance the area around it so that we can give it back the sense of dignity and historicity,\" he says. The restoration of Flora Fountain cost the civic corporation ₹3.7 crore but they also ensured that the square was cobbled and made accessible to pedestrians.

In 2008 and 2013 Congress had also promised to regularize unauthorized colonies. In 2008 it even pulled a gimmick by offering provisional regularization certificates to 1,200 colonies. Later in 2013, Sheila Dikshit had announced that 917 of these would be regularized. Arvind Kejriwal has now promised to regularize 1,797 colonies, a move that may benefit nearly 50 lakh people, nearly a fourth of the city state’s population. Like Dikshit then, Kejriwal also claims to have received a positive response from the Union Urban Development ministry.\\n\\nThe move to regularize unauthorized colonies has stirred a lot of debate in Delhi over the years. There are those who argue that it creates a moral hazard by offering a free pass to those who encroached upon public land and constructed buildings without paying heed to safety and other civic body norms relating to road width, etc. This is countered by those who blame civic agencies for not responding fast enough to migration into the city creating a huge demand for housing which enterprising racketeers and old-time politicians capitalized upon.\\n\\nWith such a huge unauthorized built-up space, it has also become a political hot potato. Demolition is simply out of the question. What the state must do now is to make the best of a bad situation. By regularizing, the cash strapped municipal corporations of Delhi can levy property taxes on these houses that have been squatting over government land for decades. Many of the unauthorized colonies in Delhi have landlords staying on the ground floor who have progressively added more storeys and rented them out making a tidy living in the process. The property taxes on the rented out storeys should now fetch more money.\\n\\nBut it is not just a one-way street. Government must also work with residents to improve civic amenities like water supply, drainage and roads in these areas. Action must also be taken against unsafe constructions, of which there are many in Delhi’s unauthorized colonies. Further, colonies that have encroached on the Yamuna flood plain or the Aravalli ridge areas do not deserve regularization. The emphasis must be on making cities livable for residents.\\n\\nIt is distressing how most big cities in India have grown exponentially with the state and civic body capacity unable to keep pace with the developmental needs of cities. Since cities are revenue generators for states it is important that municipal corporations are better staffed, are armed with effective laws, and are offered generous budgets to push modernisation schemes. Unfortunately, political parties and state governments see municipal corporations as cash cows. Unless this changes, Indians will continue to live a third world life in cities despite all the pretensions of becoming $5 trillion economy very soon.\\n\\nAAP came with the promise of transformational and alternative politics. So far it has followed Congress’s path of incremental development. It is disappointing that India’s political parties are unable to learn from global cities and envision a new model of urban government.'}, {'title': 'Stranger Things: everything you need to know before hitting Secret Cinema', 'body': 'Against all odds, Eleven and the gang are back for a new season of Stranger Things. Photograph: Landmark Media\\n\\nSo Secret Cinema is showing Stranger Things?\\n\\nYes! After years of screening movies, this is their first foray into TV. Right now, the team are turning a super-secret (obvs) London location into Hawkins, Indiana – the scariest town in America – so fans get the chance to experience it first hand. Expect: adventure, epic music, scary monsters and more 1980s nostalgia than you can shake a Rubik’s Cube at.\\n\\nSounds like I might need to brush up on my Stranger Things knowledge. First up: who’s who again?\\n\\nMike is the leader of the gang. He set out to track down missing best friend Will, remember? Mike likes three things: Dungeons & Dragons, Ghostbusters and falling for mysterious shaven-headed girls who’ve recently escaped government testing facilities.\\n\\nSounds great. Tell me more about Will.\\n\\nHe’s Hawkins’ hide-and-seek champion 1981 (eek, only joking). Will managed to outwit the Demogorgon and stay alive against all the weird supernatural odds.\\n\\nWho else is in their gang?\\n\\nLucas – he’s not into Eleven and he’s suspicious of outsiders who threaten his group. But he’s very quick on a BMX and he loves a bandana. Oh and Dustin – he’s got mild cleidocranial dysplasia (which makes him lisp), but that’s not going to slow him down talking. He’s got a crush on Mike’s sister Nancy, but strikes up a bromance with her ex-boyfriend Steve.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bigger threats await the group in the third season. Photograph: Landmark Media\\n\\nNancy? Steve?!\\n\\nYes, Nancy is Mike’s attractive older sister who barely noticed her best friend Barb was dragged into the Upside Down by a Demogorgon. Steve was officially the biggest revelation of series two, after he went from improbable-haired bully to a lad who can fight off a monster with a baseball bat with nails in it. Talk about a character arc!\\n\\nAnd you mentioned Eleven? Eleven what?\\n\\nWhat moon rock have you been hiding under? Eleven is a person – a former government experiment with psychokinetic abilities. Eleven isn’t chatty, but she can kill a man with nothing but her mind and a small nosebleed. She also loves an Eggo (a frozen waffle; guess you’d know that if you’d grown up in the US).\\n\\nAny adults in all this?\\n\\nJoyce Byers – Will’s mum, seemingly always on the verge of a breakdown (fair: she’s been through a lot) and incredibly good at building ouija boards for flashing Christmas lights. And Jim Hopper, chief of police and a divorced, bereaved, recovering alcoholic. Which doesn’t sound very cheery. But if you’ve got a problem with the Upside Down, he’ll solve it. Well, to a point …\\n\\nIs that the lot?\\n\\nOh, there’s also Jonathan Byers – Will’s older brother and school outsider, until he finally puts down his camera and hooks up with Nancy. And Billy Hargrove and Maxine “Max” Mayfield – new in town, school bully Billy is being pushed around by his abusive dad and takes it out on his younger stepsister Max.\\n\\nBitchin’. Remind me of the story so far …\\n\\nWell, season one, set in 1983, covered Will’s disappearance into the Upside Down: an extremely dark, slimy and dangerous alternate dimension hidden underneath a mysterious government testing facility, Hawkins National Laboratory. Kidnapped by a monster with a serious screaming problem – the Demogorgon – Will was dragged through a portal, and forced to hide out in the Upside Down version of Castle Byers (a makeshift fort in a forest near his house) until Dustin, Mike, Lucas and Eleven rescued him.\\n\\nAll good, right? So season two was all hugs and puppies?\\n\\nOf course not. The second season picked up with Will coughing up all manner of gross Upside Down slugs and hallucinating a giant tentacled shadow monster, the Mind Flayer, which really bummed everyone out on Halloween. This time, it’s not as easy as Will simply telling his mum what to do using a series of fairy light flashes and coded messages through the wall (duh!) – the tunnels in the Upside Down are connected to his mind through a virus. Oh, and also the kids are being hunted by a pack of mini Demogorgons, after Dustin took one in as a pet. Which sounds like a bad idea, but Dart really was very cute when Dustin found him, honestly. With Eleven’s help, they rid Will’s mind of the virus connecting him to the Upside Down and close the portal to the alternate dimension.\\n\\nSo are they safe yet?\\n\\nNo. They’re really not. The Mind Flayer is still right there outside their school. Bad luck, kids.\\n\\nGoing to Secret Cinema? Here’s the ultimate Stranger Things playlist Read more\\n\\nWhat’s hot in Hawkins?\\n\\nSo glad you asked. Most people would say Steve, with his unflattenable hair, or chief Hopper, with his gruff voice. But season three’s trailer features a topless Billy, and we don’t hate it. Oh, no, hang on – you mean culturally? The Clash’s Should I Stay Or Should I Go is the hot record (mainly because Will used it to communicate with his mum from the Upside Down, but hey, it’s also a banger). Jonathan has a poster for The Evil Dead on his wall, and we know the Eggos Eleven loves are a guaranteed sellout in this town. The new season of the show is set in 1985, the year both cult movie Back to the Future and new Coke – the disastrous sweeter recipe that landed Coke a huge national backlash in the US – launched.

Photograph: Luke Dyson/Secret Cinema\\n\\nIt’s hard to think of an experience that’s quite like film’s most exciting night out. Secret Cinema’s concept of screening a film while immersing the audience in a theatrical recreation of the world on the screen in front of them is nothing if not a unique way of doing things.\\n\\nIf you want to get the most out of it, it’s best to make sure you know how it’s done. And, given that its latest incarnation – Secret Cinema presents Stranger Things – is set to be a new direction for the event, there’s something to be learned even by those who’ve been before. Here’s a list to help you wring every last drop of joy out of the latest Secret Cinema experience:\\n\\nDon’t … forget your props\\n\\nAs well as an outfit, you’re often given a list of items to bring. These are key to the experience, with the items often serving as a form of currency you can trade with actors to unlock hidden parts of the adventure. In their take on The Empire Strikes Back, you were able to trade seeds to get passage out of Tatooine. In their recent take on Blade Runner, you could trade photographs to get you into a special area. Come well stocked if you want to get the most out of the experience.\\n\\nDo … enjoy a night without your phone\\n\\nYou know what no one had in the 1980s? Smartphones. So don’t worry about the fact that Secret Cinema requires you to seal your phone at the start of the night (you can unwrap it once it’s all over). It makes the experience all the more immersive, partly because it lets you focus, but partly because Stranger Things’ world demands that you think analogue, just like you did as a kid.\\n\\nDo … be prepared for something totally new\\n\\nSecret Cinema’s 2013 take on Terry Gilliam’s Brazil broke with tradition by letting participants continue enjoying the experiences during the film screening. But the Stranger Things experience branches out into totally new territory. According to the organisers, “the traditional screening will be replaced with a unique experience unlike anything seen in the past”. For the first time, it seems that the event is based much more around plunging guests into an immersive world than it is on a screening. Given that Secret Cinema creates such stunning recreations of cinematic universes that they sometimes outshine the actual film itself, this is a vastly exciting proposition.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In Secret Cinema’s Blade Runner event, guests traded photographs to get access to a new area of the site. Photograph: Luke Dyson/Secret Cinema\\n\\nDon’t … shy away from talking to people\\n\\nIf you want to passively consume a film then there are plenty of multiplexes available. The point of this experience is to actually be in the film, and the best way to immerse yourself in its world is by taking the plunge into talking to your favourite characters. In fact, it’s best to go even further than that and …\\n\\nDo … get into character yourself\\n\\nSecret Cinema is largely staffed by actors who are engaged in character-based improv. The more you play along, the more likely they are to appreciate it and reward you with special items or access to hidden areas. Remember, it’s your decision how involved you want to get, but you might be surprised at how easy and natural it will feel to get involved – you might just do it without realising!\\n\\nDon’t … be confused by the “secret” in the title\\n\\nWhen Secret Cinema first started, attendees didn’t know what film they were turning up to – hence the name. They were briefly known as Future Cinema when they started revealing the name of films ahead of the actual event, but a few years ago they reverted to the “secret” moniker that everyone knows and loves them for. Now the “secret” in the title refers to the fact that you never know quite how far they’ll go in their quest to instil wonder into their audience.\\n\\nEverything you need to know about Stranger Things before hitting Secret Cinema Read more\\n\\nDon’t … dawdle\\n\\nYou’ll have hours to explore the world, but it will go all too fast. So if you’re getting a drink, make sure you explore as you sip. Do marvel at the incredible sets, but do it while rampaging through them on a secret mission. It’s always a bit heartbreaking when you realise that the experience is ending – and the only way to alleviate that is to know that you didn’t waste any time while you were in there.\\n\\nDo … prepare to be blown away by the set piece\\n\\nEnding with a spectacular bit of showmanship is very much Secret Cinema’s thing, from the incredible moment in Brazil where a winged actor descended on a zipline down a multi-storey tower block, to the part in Bugsy Malone where they stopped the film, issued the audience with foam and plastic ponchos and got the crowd to recreate the on-screen action with a giant foam fight. Given that organisers are promising that this event will surpass their usual offering, with a “more intense theatrical finale with thrilling special effects”, expect it to be very special indeed.\\n\\nFor tickets to Secret Cinema presents Stranger Things and Secret Cinema presents Casino Royale, visit secretcinema.org'}, {'title': 'Not Speaking by Norma Clarke review – tight trousers and celebrity hairdressers', 'body': 'When Rena Clarke was widowed in 2006 at the age of 83, her six middle-aged children duly stepped up to the plate. Nicky, the richest, installed Rena in a luxury flat and continued to take her to church on Sunday. Another son, Michael, managed her money, while daughters Linda, Norma and Tina took turns with marathon sessions of tidying up and chucking out. But then, in the run-up to Christmas 2014, it all started to go wrong for reasons that remain obscure, even now that Norma, the clever one in the family, has set it all down in this intriguing memoir. It’s something to do with Nicky thinking that the others should make a bigger financial contribution to Rena’s upkeep, and Michael being cross about rising property prices in London. Or maybe it’s the other way round. Because, like all family rows, this ruckus has been generations in the making and its origins lie in another time and place entirely.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All manner of swagger … Nicky Clarke in 2008. Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImage\\n\\nWatching someone else’s adult family fall apart on the page is always slightly thrilling, but there’s an added kick here. Because “Nicky” is Nicky Clarke, the celebrity Mayfair hairdresser, as famous for his very tight leather trousers as he is for his way with a blow dry. “Michael” is Michael van Clarke, slightly less tightly trousered, but with an equally starry set of clients at his salon in Marylebone. Rena, meanwhile, is not simply a generic old lady but – there is no nice way to put this – a monstrous narcissist. The moment she arrives in London in 1945 as a Greek war bride, she sets out to please only herself. Never bothering with anything but broken English, by the 60s she has embarked on two long affairs with rich Cypriots, eventually giving birth to a baby girl whom she tricks husband Bill into bringing up as his own. A habitual hitter and screamer, Rena ends up in court for assaulting her lover’s girlfriend with an umbrella. The judge let her off, she explains triumphantly to Norma, because he fancied her and, anyway, the girlfriend looked really rough. Even now, at 97, Rena knows that her looks will always pull her through.\\n\\nNorma Clarke grew up as Bill and Rena’s second child in a tiny rented flat in the Old Kent Road where there was neither room nor money nor even much appetite for books. These days she is a professor of literature, which means that when she wants to understand her Anglo-Greek family’s spectacular dysfunction she instinctively reaches for Alexander Pope’s translation of The Iliad. By Clarke’s reckoning, her two hairdressing brothers have become Homer’s Achilles and Agamemnon, taking it in turns to throw their weight around before retreating to sulk in their tents. The remaining siblings, along with an assortment of cousins and ancient aunts, make up a tragic chorus, commenting noisily on what has just happened, what is happening now and what will happen next. Flame-haired Rena, meanwhile, shuttles between the rival camps of Mayfair and Marylebone, stirring things up with a well-timed dash of malice while simultaneously calling on her favourite Orthodox saints who are standing-in for the gods of Mount Olympus.\\n\\nWhile Norma was formed in a moment of postwar liberal consensus, Nicky is the product of Thatcherism’s obsession with economic individualism\\n\\nIt isn’t all quite so relentlessly high-fallutin’. Clarke specialises in 18th-century literature, which means that she is also an expert in gossip – her beloved Pope was himself a master at dishing it out. She is happy to supply us with discreet details of Nicky’s rise and rise. It starts with him sharing a flat in Norwood with Lulu’s sister in the late 70s and trying to trim the lawn with his scissors.\\n\\nFrom there we zoom through to the 90s when Fergie, the Duchess of York, turns up to the opening of his salon and cuts the ribbon in a properly mock-heroic style. There are Rolexes and apartments in Majorca and all manner of swagger involving “designer goods”. Only recently the 61-year-old Nicky announced his impending fatherhood with a picture spread in OK! magazine.\\n\\nClarke’s intention here is not to throw shade on her brother but to explore how her siblings’ remarkably diverse destinies are an expression of public history. Born in 1948, her trajectory is that of a bright, working-class child who has been kept healthy by the NHS and educated to her fullest potential by a grammar school and a university place, all paid for by the state. Exactly 10 years her junior, Nicky’s success story is of a clever if unbiddable boy who leaves school at 16 to work his socks off for himself. While Norma was formed in a moment of postwar liberal consensus, Nicky is the product of Thatcherism’s obsession with economic individualism.\\n\\nIn privileging cultural context over personal pathology, Clarke’s memoir belongs in the distinguished tradition of Carolyn Steedman’s Landscape for a Good Woman and Lorna Sage’s Bad Blood. Indeed, her mother’s pragmatic avarice starts to make sense only when you factor in the terrible conditions under which she lived as a very young woman in occupied Athens. At one point, Rena tells Norma that she and her sisters preferred being subject to the Germans rather than the British because the former had nicer manners and knew how to treat a lady (the Italians were too like the Greeks to count). It is when the British emerge decisively as the winners that the 22-year-old switches sides to throw in her lot with a handsome Cockney sergeant major who has unlimited access to Jeeps and beer. This is despite the fact that she doesn’t know a word of his language, nor he a word of hers and it pretty much stays that way for the next 60 years. It is here, in history’s cruel convulsions rather than in any individual moral failure, Clarke suggests, that the origins of her family’s catastrophic non-communication are to be found.'}, {'title': 'Freya Ridings: Freya Ridings review – dull ballads by Florence-alike flop', 'body': 'Good Soldier Records The minimalism of Ridings’ chilly piano balladry could have been bracingly different – if it wasn’t so dull\\n\\nLondon songwriter Freya Ridings found success thanks to Love Island, which played her song Lost Without You over some emotional moments in the last series.\\n\\nIt’s hard to think of an artist further from Mallorca’s teeny bikinis, burnished tans and brash emoting: Ridings specialises in chilly, pained piano balladry, and her debut album plays like a 12-part audition to bag herself this year’s John Lewis Christmas ad.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Freya Ridings: Freya Ridings album artwork\\n\\nMost of it is just Brit School graduate Ridings at the piano, playing tinkly high notes so delicate they would struggle to summon a two-inch plastic ballerina from her music-box slumber.\\n\\nYou could see her minimalist approach as admirably defiant in light of the current charts arms race – every song a firing squad of hitmakers – if it wasn’t so dull. Poison sounds like the Muzak version of Evanescence’s goth-pop classic Bring Me to Life; the shadow of Florence + the Machine hangs over everything, showing up Ridings’ meagre vocal power by comparison.\\n\\nShe can belt, and does, often, but it’s that kind of indie-voiced, back-of-throat emoting that has become a byword for authenticity. It sounds as if she’s detached her lower jaw to reach the low notes of You Mean the World to Me, while her enunciation melts on Wishbone: “Tell me that I’ll see you again” becomes “tehmethaaseeyahga”.\\n\\nWhen she and producer Greg Kurstin attempt to dress things up, the results are never anything but boilerplate. The pounding Castles wants to be Rolling in the Deep but is more splashing in the shallows. Love Is Fire hits the button marked “Edge guitar” and comfortably assumes its role as the rousing climax towards the end of her live setlists. With its hollers of “water!”, stomp and vocal frenzy, Holy Water is like a parody of bland white pop stars’ attempts to go gospel. Except it’s real.\\n\\nTying all this together are Ridings’ pained yarns of love lost, her voice wobbling so fiercely you wonder whether she was forced to record in a deep freeze. You want to offer her a blanket, suggest she deletes Tinder for a bit. Maybe a stint on Love Island would do her the world of good.'}, {'title': 'Loadsamoney! Bank of England: 325 Years, 325 Objects – review', 'body': 'By its nature, the Bank of England is a sober and slightly forbidding institution. It sets interest rates, it polices the City to make sure there is no repeat of the 2008 financial meltdown, it is responsible for supplying banknotes, and it has tons of gold stashed away in the vaults. All, for centuries past, in as unobtrusive a way as possible. Before he became governor, Mervyn King once said that he wanted decisions over the cost of borrowing to be as boring as possible.\\n\\nAll of which is fine if you want to get on with things with minimum fuss. It is more of a challenge if you are trying to open yourself up and put on an exhibition highlighting the Bank’s many faces down the years.\\n\\nThe Bank of England has always had power and influence, but arguably it has never had greater clout than it does today. Communicating better with the public is now part of the Bank’s mantra, so when it wanted to put on a show to mark its 325th birthday at the end of this month, it came up with the idea of telling the story of the past through 325 objects. It’s an ambitious endeavour that doesn’t quite come off.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chilling artefact … the Bank’s nuclear weapon effects calculator, an exhibit from 1959, to estimate damage from a nuclear attack.

It has been knee-deep in every economic and financial disaster of the past three-and-a-bit centuries, and there have been plenty, stretching all the way back to the South Sea Bubble in 1720.\\n\\nRather, it’s because the drama of financial crashes and runs on the pound is already captured by the Bank’s permanent exhibition, which surrounds and rather overwhelms the temporary show. Just by way of example, the new exhibition does not include the James Gillray cartoon from 1797 that gave the Bank its nickname of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. That has remained in its normal place.\\n\\nThe original plan, with a passing nod to Neil MacGregor’s History of the World in 100 Objects at the British Museum, was to have an exhibit for every year. It’s a pity that proved impossible, and instead the exhibition is arranged in conventional chronological blocks, starting with William III’s need to finance a war against France and ending with the decision by Gordon Brown in 1997 to grant the Bank freedom to set interest rates.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Weighty matter … scales for checking foreign coins from 1749.

It does not include the logistics of getting women to health centres, the barriers they face to access services, or other associated costs.\\n\\nThe most recent figures provided by the World Health Organization, which date back to 2015, showed the global maternal mortality ratio to be 216 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The number increased to 436 in the world’s least developed countries. The WHO is expected to update the figures later this year.\\n\\nThe UNFPA said the projections, presented in New York, should be a wake-up call for governments. The agency hopes the updated estimate will drive more funding from donors and the private sector.\\n\\n“We want to show the facts to stakeholders that this is the situation,” said Tharanga Godallage, monitoring and data specialist at the UNFPA.\\n\\n“It’s a call to action … We need to accelerate [progress] as we only have 11 years left.”\\n\\nThe agency also projected that the annual cost of meeting the growing need for modern forms of contraception would almost double, from $2.3bn in 2018 to $4.5bn by 2030.\\n\\nThe UNFPA, working with Johns Hopkins, Victoria University, the University of Washington and global health organisation Avenir Health, will present more detailed cost projections on maternal health, family planning, ending female genital mutilation and child marriage at a November summit in Kenya to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark international conference on population and development held in Cairo. Projections for individual countries will also be produced to encourage governments to increase their health budgets.\\n\\nIn 1994, 179 leaders adopted a programme of action that emphasised the centrality of women’s empowerment in tackling population growth and development, as opposed to focusing simply on family planning.

Nicknamed El Profe, the teacher, he is part man, part myth, mixing fear, fascination and fondness too, his very name striking terror into footballers’ hearts. Atlético Madrid’s fitness coach, a 61-year-old Uruguayan drill sergeant who spent the morning of the 2016 Champions League final doing laps of San Siro, Ortega likes nothing more than running them until they drop, vomit and pass out – while shouting at them. Or better still, laughing. So, ask Kieran Trippier’s new teammates what awaits him in Spain, and many would smile knowingly and reply, tongue in cheek: El Profe does.\\n\\nWhich might be just what he needs; it’s certainly a little different.\\n\\nAntoine Griezmann’s move to Barcelona was a year in the making Read more\\n\\nAtlético announced Trippier’s £20m signing at 6pm on Wednesday evening; by 6.10pm he was heading out of the team’s hotel in Los Angeles de San Rafael and off to the training pitch up in the mountains towards Segovia, where the club spend their pre-season boot camps. For the first time in 40 years, they weren’t there last summer, but now they’re back and it’s bigger, and harder, than ever before. Two gyms have been set up in marquees and alongside the pitch where Trippier is taking his first steps as an Atlético player is the Profe Slope, a 50 metre, 30% climb Ortega had built and up which he sends his players. July’s blisters are May’s strength, they like to say.\\n\\nTrippier’s timing was good: that morning, the last session before he arrived, Diego Costa had to drop out after one sprint up the Profe Slope left him dizzy and disoriented, and he has not had to follow yet. But, beware, it’s there, it will be used and they were quickly on to him. Thursday morning was tough, still felt on Thursday evening: the grin, and the sweat, spoke of the work. There will be no escape, and if Trippier is to improve anywhere, if there is a place that can make him a better defender, it is here. It is what they do.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Trippier has swapped London for Madrid and a new start at Atlético. Photograph: Europa Press via Getty Images\\n\\nHe knows that. This looks like a different Atlético, undergoing a shift in identity, those old certainties gone with the departing footballers who represented them but some things never change, some qualities are non-negotiable. Take João Felix: presented as “pure art”, then turned into a project to toughen up. And at his presentation at the Metropolitano, squeezed in between Thursday’s double session, Trippier spoke about the importance of Diego Simeone in his decision to join Atlético; he talked of the “ethic, the effort”.\\n\\nHe spoke too about the “family”. And, when it comes to the coaching staff that means a 13-man team led by El Profe and the former goalkeeper, rock singer and assistant coach Germán Burgos. Often seen as old school, this is a hands-on coaching team. Foot in, too. Simeone literally runs through every drill with them. It is a team that has not always had great luck with strikers but repeatedly developed the best defenders.\\n\\nNicknamed Mono – the monkey – Burgos is the man who once told José Mourinho he would tear his head off and the man who looked as if he probably could too. Yet he is also a man everyone loves, of warmth, an immense heart. He was talking Trippier through the movements as he was thrown straight into a starting XI of sorts, playing in a 4-4-2 alongside Savic, Felipe and Lodi in the first evening and a 4-3-1-2 with newly signed Mario Hermoso in for Felipe in the second. Three in the back four are new following the departures of Juanfran, Diego Godín and Filipe Luís, with José Giménez likely to play when he returns. The ideals persist, though, as do the traditions: the new man arrived and ran the gauntlet, teammates kicking and slapping him.\\n\\nOn Thursday evening, it was as if Burgos was man-marking Trippier, tracking his every step, talking through the positional exercises and taking up a position on his touchline in the game. Close and within earshot: “Go, go, go; calm, calm, beri gud.” At every turn and with every query Burgos was there. He was grateful for it. Trippier had spoken repeatedly during his presentation of his desire to learn Spanish – “my priority” he called it, something he always wanted to do and now has the excuse for – but it will take time. On occasions, Álvaro Morata approached to explain further.\\n\\nPlay Video 0:52 'Amazing feeling' to play abroad: Kieran Trippier on Atlético Madrid move – video\\n\\nTrippier has taken the place of Juanfran, departing after eight years. He will compete with Santiago Arias for the right-back slot, but will anticipate being a starter. His inclusion in two consecutive starting XIs underlines that, and the work to integrate him.\\n\\nA former winger converted to full-back, Juanfran’s profile – and indeed that of Arias and of Nelson Semedo, who they chased – helps challenge the myth that the role Trippier steps into is a purely defensive one. Both Juanfran on the right and Filipe Luís on the left contributed enormously in attack: width came more from them than the midfielders, who tended to be squeezed inside. That will be eventuated if Simeone sticks to the diamond midfield he is preparing here. It is one of the reasons why they have focused on the Englishman – their first since a striker called Drinkwater 90 years ago and only their second ever.\\n\\nTransfer window: the key deals in Europe away from the Premier League Read more\\n\\nAtletico’s president, Enrique Cerezo, talked about the importance of Trippier’s quality, his ability to deliver telling passes, crosses and dead balls and, while he was reading from a prepared sheet, this is a key element. Trippier will not be expected to defend only, but to play. That was clear in the session: defensively, his position will probably be deeper, with less space behind him, but with the ball they sought him early and high, out on the touchline, the man to provide the final cross.\\n\\nThat’s the part they bought and will work on, providing the structure and position from which he can provide the passes. But it is not the only thing, not their badge of identity during the Simeone years. The effort, the physique, the defending is something they can build, as they have done so many times before. And it all begins with a run up a man-made hill, built to make them sweat.\"}, {'title': 'Pardon the rant, but here’s why I love my Mooncup so much | Sophie Wilkinson', 'body': 'If you’re a Guardian-reading woman of a certain age, it’s likely you’ll have been party to the evangelical Mooncup rant. In the Mooncup rant, one woman tells the other about a convex piece of medical-grade silicone that has saved her life. She uses it each time she gets her period, and spends the rest of her time talking about it. The cup has saved her thousands, is proof of her eco credentials and is now, essentially, the best thing ever.\\n\\nI’m relatively new to menstrual cups, turning to them two years ago after an organic tampon company’s cardboard applicators injured my gentlest parts. And I’ve got the devotion of a convert, regularly proselytising about my Mooncup with all the spittle-flecked frenzy of a televangelist. A new study published by the Lancet this week has proved my claims. Researchers from the Medical Research Council, the Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust found that menstrual cups were just as reliable as tampons.\\n\\nThink of the money huge corporations can gain from making us feel our periods are dirty, nasty, secret things\\n\\nTo us Mooncup ranters, this news could make our cup of smugness runneth over. We could now hold up the evidence cited in the Lancet study that 70% of women who used them wanted to continue with them as proof and defence of our righteousness. But I’m not going to do that.\\n\\nI’ll acknowledge there are obstacles to Mooncup usage – some women aren’t comfortable with using internal menstrual products. And some women live in places without access to the running water required to sterilise menstrual cups. These women may prefer to use pads, and might find period absorption knickers a more appropriate reusable alternative.\\n\\nMany women in the UK, I’d hazard, are in neither camp. Yet Mooncups still seem iffy. The ecological argument is well-worn: Mooncups save the planet’s landfills from the scourge of cotton slabs, fiddly plastic tampon plungers and supposedly discreet packaging that glows with all the luminescence of a bag of Tangfastics. But this adds to the unfair pressure on women (who use makeup wipes and nappies and plastic straws way more than men do) to cut out single-use plastics.\\n\\nSo my sermon is the simple fact that my Mooncup brought me closer to my body. The stigma of periods hasn’t precluded me from writing about it for a national newspaper, but still, I appreciate that a Mooncup can be transported and inserted silently, unlike tampons with their noisy wrappers.\\n\\n‘We don’t need to bleed’: why many women are giving up on periods Read more\\n\\nFurthermore, for me, using tampons could sometimes be quite painful. The Mooncup takes a little getting used to but sits easier, and I’m more in touch with it when it needs changing. Rather than adding to landfill I pour my blood down the toilet, and as it tumbles through the water like red clouds I can see my body has done something natural, and beautiful. My cup comes with a Plimsoll line, so I can tell how much I’ve bled, and means I can confidently tell my GP that, yes, I have heavy periods, and, yes, I need those life-saving painkillers, thank you very much.\\n\\nIf my Mooncup adoration sounds too loved-up, think of the romance tampon adverts have been selling for decades. Think of the money huge corporations can gain from making us feel our periods are dirty, nasty, secret things that must be plugged up rather than collected. Think of the freedom of knowing that an item costing under £30 could see you through every single period over the next 10 years. Plus, once you’ve got a Mooncup, you never have to endure one of these rants again.\\n\\n• Sophie Wilkinson is a freelance journalist who specialises in entertainment, celebrity, gender and sexuality'}, {'title': 'Feline queasy: eight urgent questions about the Cats trailer', 'body': 'If you saw the Cats trailer last night, you won’t have slept and may still be shaking. Here, we begin the process of trying to understand what happened\\n\\nThere was a time in your life before you saw the Cats trailer. That’s hard to believe, I know. It might feel as if your every waking moment since birth has been plagued by monstrous visions of howling piliferous, sexualised Brundleflies, but I assure you this is merely a blip. Soon, some other supposedly prestigious director will release a trailer for another terrible musical where the cast have been digitised to look nightmarish and half-formed, and you will move on.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I have some questions about the Cats trailer.\\n\\n1. How big are the cats?\\n\\nThis shouldn’t be difficult. In TS Eliot’s poetry collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the cats are the size of cats. In the stage musical Cats, the cats are the size of people. But here? It’s hard to know. In one shot, a cat just about fits into a standard dustbin (too big for a cat), another gets its paw stuck in a standard mousetrap (the correct size for a cat). Then there’s this shot, where an entire cat is roughly the size of a standard dining knife (too small for a cat, much too small for a cat). How the hell are audiences supposed to enjoy Cats if they’re constantly trying to discern scale, Tom Hooper?\\n\\n2. Why does Dame Judi Dench, a cat with fur, wear a coat that is made of her own fur?\\n\\nDid Dench specifically grow out her fur so that she could cut it off and make it into a coat for her to wear, even though that would be redundant because she was already wearing the fur? Or did she seek out a number of cats with identical fur to hers – maybe even her own relatives – and brutally skin them so she could wear them as a garment? Is Dame Judi Dench the Ed Gein of cats? Logically, it has to be one or the other.\\n\\n3. Why do the cats have breasts?\\n\\n“Remember Catwoman? She’s sexy, right?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Yes Tom, she’s sexy”.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Could we make our cats as sexy as Catwoman?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I’m not sure that would work, Tom. Catwoman is a woman who simply assumes feline characteristics, whereas the cats in Cats are literally cats.”\\n\\n\\n\\n“I get it. It’s OK to want to have sex with Catwoman, because when she takes her clothes off she’s a naked human being. But it isn’t OK to want to have sex with a cat, because cats are already naked, and if they take their fur off then they’re just pulsating masses of blood and sinew?”\\n\\n“Yes Tom, that’s exactly it.”\\n\\n“Nah, screw it, let’s give them tits anyway.”\\n\\n4. When will Rebel Wilson ever catch a break?\\n\\nBy now, Rebel Wilson has played the exact same character in about 300 films. The repetition of having to be the clumsy, too-confident, overweight comic relief again and again, no matter the film, must be exhausting. So she must have been thrilled to get a call to play a role in a tentpole film by the Oscar-winning director of Les Misérables. Except, oh, wait, no, she’s playing the exact same character in this as well. Still, at least this character is covered in a kind of harrowing woodland moss. That’s something, right?\\n\\n5. Wait, did James Corden just vomit into another cat’s face?\\n\\nFinally, a question with an answer. James Corden did not vomit into another cat’s face. James Corden spat food into another cat’s face. I hope this helps.\\n\\n6. JASON DERULO?\\n\\nJason Derulo, performer of hits like Swalla, Wiggle and That’s My Shhh? Jason Derulo, deliverer of the lyric “Is it weird that your bra reminds me of a Katy Perry song”? Jason Derulo, whose biggest screen role until now has been playing Ronald Dawson in one episode of the little-loved television adaptation of Lethal Weapon? Yes. That Jason Derulo.\\n\\n7. Just how badly does Jennifer Hudson want another Oscar?\\n\\nHugely. Enormously. With every atom of her being. Hudson’s rendition of Memory in the Cats trailer – performed in the manner of someone standing on a motorway bridge trying to warn motorists of a cow in the road – is clearly meant to be this film’s answer to Anne Hathaway’s I Dreamed a Dream moment in Les Misérables. That performance won Hathaway an Oscar. However, that was because Hathaway was playing an orphaned sex worker who has to sell her own teeth to feed her daughter, set against the backdrop of France’s violent June Rebellion; and not, say, a funny cat in a film about cats.\\n\\n8. What am I doing with my hands?\\n\\nOh, that’s right, I’m involuntarily peeling the skin off them because apparently that sensation is preferable to looking at any more footage of screaming, digitally augmented, uncanny valley feline hell-mutants. This trailer made me vomit, and wet myself, and now I’m peeling the skin off my own hands.

He averaged more than point a game, is second in NHL history in assists behind Wayne Gretzky and fifth in career points.\\n\\nWhen CEO Tod Leiweke and the ownership group of the Seattle NHL expansion team looked at his playing resume, though, they were most impressed by another statistic: Francis was voted captain by three teams for 14 of his 23 years, first earning the role at age 21.\\n\\nThat leadership ability spurred them to hire Francis on Thursday as general manager of the yet-to-be-named team — well ahead of their schedule.\\n\\n“Ownership made an incredible commitment . in supporting this idea of let’s do this a year early,” Leiweke said. “If we’re really here working for our fans, let’s reward their belief. They said we’re willing to make this commitment a year early. We’re willing to bring on a general manager earlier than any other expansion team in the history of the NHL and that gift of an additional year will serve us well and give us a chance to scout and build and plan. But we had to find the right person.”\\n\\nThey believe the 56-year-old Francis is that person, announcing his hiring at a news conference that was attended by the mayor and a state senator. He’ll have complete control of building the organization under Leiweke. He said he’s already drawn up an organizational chart that will guide hiring as the team prepares to open play in 2021 as the NHL’s 32nd franchise.\\n\\nAnd he’s already started daydreaming about how his team will look.\\n\\n“I think if you look at my past experience, it’s a team that’s fast,” Francis said. “I think it’s a team that needs to have skill and hockey sense. I like a team that’s extremely competitive. And for me I think you need a team that has character. It’s easy to be a good person when things are going well. When things get a little bit tough, that’s when character rises to the top and pulls you through those tough times.”\\n\\nCharacter defined Francis’ playing career. Jaromir Jagr, his teammate on the 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup-winning Pittsburgh Penguins, called Francis perhaps the most underrated player in NHL history.

Essendon\\'s interest stemmed from the fact that Neale Daniher was assisting his old club in their coach search. Daniher was close to Fagan from their near-decade together at Melbourne, and knew what Hawthorn\\'s football department boss could bring. The Bombers duly appointed John Worsfold, a decision that had been flagged early in the process when a posse of officials and players flew to Adelaide in chairman Paul Little\\'s private jet, importuning Worsfold to apply for the job. Fagan, then 54, seemed to have missed his chance. Indeed, he\\'d figured that he wouldn\\'t land a senior coaching gig in 2005 when he agreed to move from Daniher\\'s coaching group to run the Demons\\' footy department. By 2016, he was an age (55) when most coaches were winding up or done. He had never played at AFL level and did not present as the kind of domineering alpha male that clubs often favoured. And, after six years as \"director of coaching\" at the Hawks, he\\'d been an administrator since 2013.\\n\\nIn retrospect, this detour to management would prove beneficial, providing Fagan with the experience of managing staff, delegating down and reporting \"up\" to the chief executive and board – parts of the senior coach\\'s lot that almost no one experiences before landing the gig. Today, as the Brisbane Lions sit inside the top four, Chris Fagan is viewed as a new model for a senior coach, having shifted perceptions about what matters in coaching and the ideal background for a senior coach. Fagan celebrates with the Lions after they make it two straight at the beginning of the 2019 season. Credit:AAP The AFL\\'s head of game analysis, long-serving ex-Hawthorn assistant coach David Rath, believed the Lions\\' progress under Fagan was impacting upon what clubs perceived as \"the necessary background and attributes needed to be an AFL coach\". As they sift through candidates, weighing up their pros and cons, it is safe to assume that one or more of Carlton, St Kilda and North Melbourne have asked this question: Is there another Chris Fagan out there?\\n\\nIf we look beyond the blinkered, insular universe of AFL clubs, Fagan\\'s life story and resume is far closer to the elite coaches in Europe and the United States, where experience in coaching, people management skills and teaching prowess – plus tertiary qualifications – trump whatever the coach did as an athlete/player. In 2014, an academic from the University of Queensland, Dr Steven Rynne, conducted a research project that sought to create a profile of an elite coach in international sports. Dr Rynne used 14 well-known coaches across elite sports – five team sports and nine individual sports. This study was handed to the AFL Coaches Association\\'s Mark Brayshaw by Mark Riley, the long-time AFL assistant coach and Melbourne caretaker coach in 2007. None of the 14 were Australian, but hockey\\'s Rick Charlesworth and rugby league\\'s Wayne Bennett were considered close to the prototype. All 14 had (coached) gold medals and/or major titles at the highest level over a \"prolonged period\" and with different athletes or teams, including leading football/soccer coaches. The identikit of these elite coaches is closer to a match with Fagan than virtually any other current AFL coach. Most significantly, the average age of the super 14 was 55, ranging in age from 44 to 67.\\n\\nTheir average years coaching was 29, with more than 25 of those years spent coaching at the top level. The difference with Fagan is that he\\'s been involved at the highest level for 22 years but not as head coach. All bar one of the 14 had tertiary qualifications – as Fagan, who came to footy in Tasmania as a teacher, does. All 14 were married men, 13 had children. Emotional intelligence – Fages has that in spades. There\\'s a genuine investment in people. That\\'s his strong suit. David Rath, AFL head of game analysis While most competed at the elite level, Rynne later told Brayshaw that the bulk of his super 14 were relative \"plodders\" who had to \"wring out all they had just to stay in the game\" - a description that matches the litany of rugged back pockets-turned coaches, from Tom Hafey, Kevin Sheedy and David Parkin to Mick Malthouse and Damien Hardwick. Fagan, a capable footballer in Tasmania, didn\\'t play at league level.\\n\\nTo profile the coaches\\' personalities, Rynne used \"The Big Five\" psychological traits that are commonly used in contemporary psychology, with people usually measured on a scale of 1 to 5 on these traits: extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism. Overall, Dr Rynne found these coaches high in conscientiousness and extraversion and low in neuroticism. As low scorers in neuroticism, they worried little about those underneath posing a threat. The study summed up their key personalities traits thus: \"Diligent and disciplined, emotionally stable and secure, quite sociable and enjoy challenges.\" Dr Rynne also told Brayshaw back in 2014 that these coaches \"are not easily upset\" and scored high on optimism. They liked to empower athletes and delegate to assistants underneath. They had, as Rynne wrote, \"a clear vision that each wants and needs to be done in this regard – accompanied by a will and zeal to work and focus hard to reach set targets\".\\n\\nMany, though not all, of these traits apply to Fagan, who wouldn\\'t be high in extraversion, but is renowned for his composure and empathy. Lions football boss David Noble said \"calm\" was the word that best described Fagan, who delegated to the point that he seldom ran training, preferring to sit back and assess. \"He has clarity, he\\'s clear, our game plan is clear,\" said Noble, who can only recall \"three or four times\" when Fagan \"let rip\" and castigated the players. Rath observed: \"Emotional intelligence – Fages has that in spades. There\\'s a genuine investment in people. That\\'s his strong suit.\" Fagan greets fans at the Gabba.

But people often have no idea that their faces ended up in them. And while names are typically not attached to the photos, individuals can be recognised because each face is, well, unique to a person. Facial recognition technology at a train station in China, where commuters are scored on their behaviour for a national \"social credit\" system. Credit:Sanghee Liu Questions about the datasets are rising because the technologies that they have enabled are being used in potentially invasive ways. Documents released last week revealed the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials employed facial recognition technology to scan drivers\\' photos to identify unauthorised immigrants. The FBI also spent more than a decade using such systems to compare driver\\'s licence and visa photos against the faces of suspected criminals, according to a Government Accountability Office report last month. There is no oversight of the datasets. Activists and others say they are angered by the possibility that people\\'s likenesses had been used to build ethically questionable technology and that the images could be misused. At least one facial database created in the United States was shared with a company in China that has been linked to ethnic profiling of the country\\'s minority Uighur Muslims. Over the past several weeks, some companies and universities, including Microsoft and Stanford, removed their facial datasets from the internet because of privacy concerns. But given that the images were already so well distributed, they are most likely still being used in the US and elsewhere, researchers and activists said.\\n\\n\"You come to see that these practices are intrusive, and you realise that these companies are not respectful of privacy,\" said Liz O\\'Sullivan, who oversaw one of these databases at the artificial intelligence startup Clarifai. She said she left the New York-based company in January to protest such practices. Loading \"The more ubiquitous facial recognition becomes, the more exposed we all are to being part of the process,\" she said. Google, Facebook and Microsoft declined to comment. One database, which dates to 2014, was put together by researchers at Stanford. It was called Brainwash, after a San Francisco cafe of the same name, where the researchers tapped into a camera. Over three days, the camera took more than 10,000 images, which went into the database, the researchers wrote in a 2015 paper. The paper did not address whether cafe patrons knew their images were being taken and used for research. (The cafe has closed.)\\n\\nThe Stanford researchers then shared Brainwash. According to research papers, it was used in China by academics associated with the National University of Defence Technology and Megvii, an artificial intelligence company previously reported as having provided surveillance technology for monitoring Uighurs. Loading The Brainwash dataset was removed from its original website last month after Adam Harvey, an activist in Germany who tracks the use of these repositories through a website called MegaPixels, drew attention to it. Links between Brainwash and papers describing work to build AI systems at the National University of Defence Technology in China have also been deleted, according to documentation from Harvey. Stanford researchers who oversaw Brainwash did not respond to requests for comment. \"As part of the research process, Stanford routinely makes research documentation and supporting materials available publicly,\" a university official said. \"Once research materials are made public, the university does not track their use nor did university officials.\" Duke University researchers started a database in 2014 using eight cameras on campus to collect images, according to a 2016 paper published as part of the European Conference on Computer Vision. The cameras were denoted with signs, said Carlo Tomasi, the Duke computer science professor who helped create the database. The signs gave a number or email for people to opt out.\\n\\nThe Duke researchers ultimately gathered more than 2 million video frames with images of more than 2700 people, according to the paper. They also posted the dataset, named Duke MTMC, online. It was later cited in myriad documents describing work to train AI in the US, China, Japan, Britain and elsewhere. Loading Tomasi said that his research group did not do facial recognition and that the MTMC was unlikely to be useful for such technology because of poor angles and lighting. \"Our data was recorded to develop and test computer algorithms that analyse complex motion in video,\" he said. \"It happened to be people, but it could have been bicycles, cars, ants, fish, amoeba or elephants.\" At Microsoft, researchers have claimed on the company\\'s website to have created one of the biggest facial datasets. The collection, called MS Celeb, spanned over 10 million images of more than 100,000 people.\\n\\nMS Celeb was ostensibly a database of celebrities, whose images are considered fair game because they are public figures. But MS Celeb also brought in photos of privacy and security activists, academics and others, such as Shoshana Zuboff, the author of the book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, according to documentation from Harvey of the MegaPixels project. MS Celeb was distributed internationally before being removed this spring after Harvey and others flagged it. Kim Zetter, a cybersecurity journalist in San Francisco who has written for Wired and The Intercept, was one of the people who unknowingly became part of the Microsoft dataset. \"We\\'re all just fodder for the development of these surveillance systems,\" she said. \"The idea that this would be shared with foreign governments and military is just egregious.\" This week, the Russian-built FaceApp went viral and caused people to worry about their privacy. The app uses AI to alter photos, making people younger or older, to some amusing results. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay tested out FaceApp. Credit:Twitter/Gordon Ramsay\\n\\nTo be able to do that, the app keeps a copy of the pictures on a server, not on users\\' phones. The spate of celebrity posts featuring the realistic results prompted people to wonder if their faces and data were safe. The company\\'s privacy terms are vague, prompting security experts to urge users to exercise caution. Matt Zeiler, founder and chief executive of Clarifai, said his company had built a facial database with images from OkCupid, a dating site. He said Clarifai had access to OkCupid\\'s photos because some of the dating site\\'s founders invested in his company. He added that he had signed a deal with a large social media company — he declined to disclose which — to use its images in training facial recognition models. The social network\\'s terms of service allow for this kind of sharing, he said. \"There has to be some level of trust with tech companies like Clarifai to put powerful technology to good use and get comfortable with that,\" he said.\\n\\nAn OkCupid spokeswoman said that Clarifai contacted the company in 2014 \"about collaborating to determine if they could build unbiased AI and facial recognition technology\" and that the dating site \"did not enter into any commercial agreement then and have no relationship with them now.\" She did not address whether Clarifai had gained access to OkCupid\\'s photos without its consent. Clarifai used the images from OkCupid to build a service that could identify the age, sex and race of detected faces, Zeiler said. The startup also began working on a tool to collect images from a website called Insecam — short for \"insecure camera\"— which taps into surveillance cameras in city centres and private spaces without authorisation. Clarifai\\'s project was shut down last year after some employees protested and before any images were gathered, he said. Zeiler said Clarifai would sell its facial recognition technology to foreign governments, military operations and police departments provided the circumstances were right. It did not make sense to place blanket restrictions on the sale of technology to entire countries, he added. O\\'Sullivan, the former Clarifai technologist, has joined a civil rights and privacy group called the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. She is now part of a team of researchers building a tool that will let people check whether their image is part of the openly shared facial databases. \"You are part of what made the system what it is,\" she said.\\n\\nThe New York Times'}, {'title': \"George Calombaris' underpayment woes not over as more workers come forward\", 'body': '\"We have always invited current and former staff to come forward, and that is still open,\" the spokesman said. Loading \"On the back of the high profile case in the last 24 hours, two further staff have come forward to say they believe they have been underpaid.\" The raft of breaches by Made Establishment, uncovered by the Fair Work Ombudsman during a four-year investigation, included failing to pay minimum award rates, penalty rates, casual loadings, overtime rates, split-shift allowances and annual leave loadings. The full extent of the underpayment scandal is much higher than initial estimates by Calombaris from April 2017, when his company announced that 162 workers had been underpaid $2.6 million because of \"historically poor processes\".\\n\\nCalombaris addressed staff and apologised on Thursday, saying he was \"committed to acting as a force for change in the industry and leading by example\". However, restaurant lobby boss Wes Lambert said the hospitality industry was facing a wipeout unless Australians were prepared to pay more for a cup of coffee and food. Mr Lambert, the chief executive of the Restaurant and Catering Industry Association, said there was no excuse for underpaying staff. He said all businesses have the resources they need to ensure they are compliant. But he said the industry was becoming less profitable, as year-on-year costs rise while menu prices stay the same.\\n\\n\"The statistics say it\\'s becoming less profitable, yes, something has to give eventually,\" Mr Lambert said. Loading \"If the price of a cup of coffee stays $4 for five years, something has got to give, it doesn\\'t work. The price of a steak, the price of a meal cannot stay the same price. The maths doesn\\'t work. Ultimately, if consumers want to only pay $4 for a coffee, then the industry gets smaller and smaller.\" He said wages, rent, and the price of food, electricity, and gas had all skyrocketed. \"The price of restaurant menus has not kept up with rising costs,\" Mr Lambert said.\\n\\nThe lobby boss claimed hospitality businesses were closing faster than they were opening. \"When Fair Work sets wages and you have suppliers setting the cost of food and beverage, and the landlord is holding you to the lease you signed for 10 years ... and your electricity provider and gas provider and insurance provider ... are raising costs, there is only one way to go. \"You either stay open with increased prices, or you close.\" But Unions NSW Secretary Mark Morey said wage theft was in no way acceptable and laws against it needed to be strengthened. \"We also need a profound cultural shift. As a society we need to make it clear that wage theft is repugnant,\" he said.\\n\\nThe restaurant association - which advocates for about 47,500 cafes, restaurants and caterers across Australia - has a hotline to provide hospitality bosses workplace advice and receives about 50 to 100 calls a week. The Fair Work Ombudsman has an online calculator to help with compliance. Last year, Fair Work said restaurants, cafes and takeaway stores made up about 29 per cent of the ombudsman\\'s legal action. Other restaurants in the high-end dining industry, associated with Neil Perry, Heston Blumenthal, Shannon Bennett, Teage Ezard, Justin Hemmes and Guillaume Brahimi have all been accused of underpaying staff. The underpayment revelations have sparked renewed calls for tougher penalties and the criminalisation of wage theft to deter rogue operators from exploiting their workers, while unions are also calling for Calombaris to be axed from MasterChef.'}, {'title': 'Somehow, everyone inside a house that blew apart around them survived', 'body': '\"Five properties have been severely affected by fire and one has been destroyed.

The brick property was gutted by the explosion, its wooden roof almost entirely blown away, and brick, stone, wood, insulation and metal debris strewn across the garden, road, cars, and nearby houses. While two vehicles were still parked on the driveway at the front, the rear of the house appeared to have been obliterated, flames shooting high in the air from an enormous pile of twisted rubble, wood, metal and household items.\\n\\nThe blast badly damaged neighbouring properties - the walls of number 11 next door demolished from its impact.

US President Donald Trump said he withdrew because the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), did not do enough to curb Iran\\'s ballistic missiles programme or address its support for regional armed groups.\\n\\nHis administration has since launched a \"maximum pressure campaign\" aimed at slashing Iran\\'s oil exports to zero, including by threatening to target any companies or countries that skirt US sanctions and forcing Tehran to open negotiations on a broader new deal.\\n\\nAmid a flurry of diplomatic activities, the European signatories to the JCPOA have tried for months to convince Iran to stay in the deal, including by launching a financial mechanism to maintain limited trade with it.\\n\\nBut observers believe that unless Tehran promptly gets substantial benefits for its sanctions-hit economy, in exchange for giving up its large-scale nuclear enrichment under the pact, then Europe\\'s ongoing effort would not be enough.\\n\\n\"To the Iranians, this is a cruel joke. Iran needs and expects tangible sanctions relief in line with what is required by the nuclear deal,\" Sina Toossi, of the Washington, DC-based National Iranian American Council (NIAC), said.\\n\\nHe added that it is \"unlikely\" Europe will be able to accomplish what Iran is asking, namely oil purchases and the normalisation of banking ties.\\n\\n\"The fact is that European leaders have not shown the political will necessary to assert their independence vis-a-vis the US and forcefully push back against the threat of secondary sanctions,\" Toossi said.\\n\\nFlurry of diplomatic activities\\n\\nDiplomatic efforts have intensified since July 7, when Iran increased the level of uranium enrichment from 3.67 percent to 4.5 percent - just above the limit set under the deal - following the expiration of a two-month deadline it had set to European powers to protect it from US sanctions. The following day, Tehran gave Europe another 60 days to come up with a mechanism to facilitate oil trade amid growing US-Iran tensions and international fears that hawks in Washington are attempting to draw the countries into an armed confrontation.\\n\\nIran\\'s seizure of a foreign tanker, which was reported on Thursday, as well as the recent incidents of cargo ship attacks and drone shooting in waters off Iran, have also added to the atmosphere of insecurity and fuelled doubts that a diplomatic solution could ever be put together, observers said. Late on Thursday, it was also reported that a US warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz.\\n\\n\\n\\nIran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday made it clear that his country would continue to roll back its commitment under the JCPOA, pointedly blaming Europe for not fulfilling their part of the bargain and lashing out at Western \"arrogance\" and \"insolence\".\\n\\n\\n\\nA day earlier, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also struck a defiant tone, saying Tehran was willing to restore its full compliance of the nuclear agreement, only if the US lifted oil and banking sanctions and returned to what was agreed in 2015.\\n\\n190708165205048\\n\\nDuring a visit this week to the United Nations\\'s headquarters in New York, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif repeated Rouhani\\'s call, saying that \"once the sanctions are lifted ... the room for negotiation is wide open\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is the United States that left the bargaining table. And they\\'re always welcome to return,\" Zarif said, noting that the US \"shot itself [in] the foot\" when it abandoned the JCPOA. As it is, Zarif said, the Trump administration was already waging an economic war against the Iranian people.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a separate interview, Zarif ominously warned that while his country will not initiate an armed conflict, \"anybody who starts a war with Iran will not be the one who ends it.\"\\n\\nEuropean foreign ministers have been scrambling to find a solution to the worsening crisis. On Monday, they huddled in Brussels and urged Tehran to avoid more actions that endanger the deal. Yet again, they failed to spell out specific economic steps to satisfy Iran.\\n\\nIn response, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Seyed Abbas Mousavi said Europe should not have an \"unrealistic expectation\" if they are unable to deliver on their promise. He said Iran would only stay committed to the deal at the same level as Europe kept its obligations.\\n\\nIran has already stated that INSTEX, the special purpose vehicle created by Europe to process payments bypassing the US financial system, is insufficient as it only allows trade for humanitarian activities that are not even covered by US secondary sanctions.

So for now, no EU penalties are in the works against Iran, she added.\\n\\n\\'On the edge\\'\\n\\nOn Iran\\'s part, the incremental steps taken to walk away from the deal are meant as leverage to push Europe into action, said Noorani, the Tokyo-based Iranian journalist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I think Iran is on the edge now,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf Europe fails to deliver in the next few weeks, and Trump piles on more pressure, \"Iran will have no recourse but to increase its own pressure, by increasing its nuclear capability,\" added Toossi, of NIAC.\\n\\n190707051824231\\n\\nAmong the options Iran is reportedly considering is raising uranium enrichment to 20 percent, which is the level maintained before signing the JCPOA in 2015. Some experts, however, disputed that number, calling it a \"hype\" aimed at the Europeans.\\n\\n\\n\\nUltimately, it may not be up to Europe, but Trump to roll the dice and talk to Iran, said Abas Aslani, a Tehran-based foreign policy expert affiliated with the Rouhani administration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He has to make a decision to accept the reality, to come to talk to Iran,\" Aslani said, while pointing to the hurdles faced by the US president.\\n\\nTrump\\'s \\'disoriented\\' policy\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump reportedly tapped anti-war Senator Rand Paul as a special emissary to talk to Iranian officials. But it is not clear how much mandate he has to negotiate, given the presence of hawks in the Trump administration and the White House, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton.\\n\\nWhile Iran has let the \"window towards diplomacy open\", Trump\\'s allies in the region, as well as the people around him, may \"not like any kind of engagement or negotiations\" to happen, Aslani pointed out.\\n\\n\"They have capitalised and invested a lot on Iranian isolation, rather than engagement. That is why it has become a little bit difficult for Trump to engage in any talks.\"\\n\\nFor Noorani, Trump\\'s \"disoriented\" policy towards Iran, has left Tehran confused about Washington\\'s real intentions, further muddling any prospect of rapprochement.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince Iran\\'s shift \"from the policy of strategic patience to active resistance\", the US has been indirectly more involved diplomatically with Iran, according to Younes Zangiabadi, cofounder of the Geneva-based Institute for Diplomacy and Peace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It is important to underline that Trump is personally pushing and following up on meetings between Iran and the allies of the US,\" he told Al Jazeera.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, France is also trying \"to create the right environment\" for the inclusion of the US in talks with Iran within the JCPOA framework, \"at least as an observer for the initial steps,\" Zangiabadi said.\\n\\nNow it is up to the French side, to convince Trump \"to impose no more sanctions\" and freeze some of the current banking and oil sanctions, if they want any form of negotiations to take place between Tehran and Washington, he said.\\n\\nFreeze for freeze\\n\\nAmong the options being considered is the so-called \"freeze-for-freeze\" deal, in which the US will suspend the Iran sanctions, or parts of it, and in return, Iran will stop reducing its JCPOA commitments, or the pace of its nuclear activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the Iranians, it would be doubtful that they would bow down to Trump\\'s \"maximum pressure\" and \"bullying\", despite the hardships ordinary citizens are facing under the current sanctions, Zangiabadi said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is because there is an \"unusual consensus across the Iranian political spectrum that now is not the right time to negotiate with the US,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Fereshteh Sadeghi, a Tehran-based political analyst, acknowledged that \"there is anger regarding the current economic situation\" in the country. However, it is less directed at Trump, than the Iranian establishment\\'s \"mismanagement and rampant corruption\".\\n\\nYet, the dire economic situation and the public pressure have not had an effect on whether or not Iran wants to talk to the US, she said, adding that as long as the government is surviving, it will dictate when and how it wants to talk to Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the end, the fate of Iran and the entire region lays in the hands of the US president, Toossi argued.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The principal problem is Trump\\'s disastrous Iran policy, which has needlessly and recklessly put the two countries on a collision course.\"'}, {'title': 'Pre-Crime: Has Minority Report-style Policing Become a Reality?', 'body': 'Police are using technology and data to predict behaviour and prevent crime - but are innocent people being targeted?\\n\\nWhat if you could predict a crime before it happens?\\n\\nIt\\'s the stuff of science fiction - the film Minority Report, set in the year 2054, imagines police officers that arrest individuals for crimes not yet committed.\\n\\nTheir fictional department is called \"Pre-Crime\".

Here's How to Write a Good One\", 'body': 'I\\'ve traveled a fair amount for work, and I\\'ve learned to appreciate the little things that make being away from home just a bit easier. Once, when I checked into a hotel, I got this friendly note. It was a nice gesture -- almost.\\n\\nThe envelope the hotel slid under the door had my name on it, but when I opened it, I found a nice note written to Cedric. Here\\'s the thing: I\\'m not Cedric. Cedric wasn\\'t staying with me, and I don\\'t think I actually even know anyone named Cedric. Well, actually it wasn\\'t \"written\" to Cedric. It was printed off on a computer in one of those \"handwriting\" fonts.\\n\\nWhich made me think about one of the most underrated yet powerful tools in your relationship toolbox--the handwritten note. I\\'m a big fan. Well, except when it\\'s a computer-printed pseudo handwritten note to someone else. That\\'s just embarrassing.\\n\\nBut when you do it right, I can\\'t think of many things that have a greater return on your effort than taking five minutes to write a quick note to someone, sticking a stamp on it, and dropping it in the mail. Here are a few tips for writing handwritten notes to clients or customers:\\n\\nMake it a habit.\\n\\nThat\\'s partly because no one actually does it anymore, which is crazy when you think about it. Everyone loves getting handwritten personal notes.\\n\\nThere\\'s something about the experience of going to the mailbox, sifting through the junk, finding something with your name across the front, and opening it to find a note written with real ink on paper.\\n\\nWhen you get a note that has been written by hand, it communicates that you were important enough for someone to stop what they were doing, sit down at their desk, take out a pen and paper, and write down something meaningful.\\n\\nWhen I was in sales, I made it a point to send a handwritten note to every client that booked, every time someone placed an order, and whenever someone sent a referral.\\n\\nI also made it a habit to write three or four handwritten notes every week to existing clients, partners, or other connections. It\\'s a great tool to reinforce the connection you have with your clients, and if you do it right, it can have a huge impact.\\n\\nBe personal, be authentic, and be brief.\\n\\nFortunately, writing a good note isn\\'t that complicated. In fact, following these three rules will help you make a personal impact. Good handwritten notes should be personal to the person you\\'re writing to, not something generic. They should also be authentic, meaning they should fit naturally into the relationship, not something you write just to sell something. Finally, they should be brief. This isn\\'t a love letter, it\\'s a brief note to say thanks, or to congratulate someone on a significant event.\\n\\nBy the way, never, ever include your business card.\\n\\nHere\\'s the thing, when you include your business card, you basically cancel out every ounce of personal connection since it\\'s now clear that the only thing you were really trying to do is get your information in front of me.\\n\\nIt\\'s like doing something really nice for someone and making sure they know you were the one that did it.

Thirty-eight percent of us sometimes or often avoid it. It\\'s not hard to see why.\\n\\nWith political feuding at what feels like an all-time high, natural disasters popping up like a terrifying game of whack-a-mole, and a drumbeat of grim stories about how hard it is for many around the globe to merely survive, keeping up with the headlines can be dispiriting.\\n\\nBut while the challenges facing the world are undeniable, they aren\\'t the whole story. Scandals and disasters get the most clicks, nudging newsrooms to focus on the negative, but around the world ordinary citizens, scientists, and courageous leaders are working to make the world a better place.\\n\\nFocusing on these bright spots isn\\'t just good for your mental health, it\\'s also a way to be a better citizen. Positivity begets positivity, and when you have hope, you\\'re more likely to take action to do your bit to improve our world.\\n\\nCongressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put this beautifully in conversation with youth climate activity Greta Thunberg recently: \"Hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious.\"\\n\\nHow can you defy your (understandable) urge to just stick your head in the stand? Smile-inducing website Positive News is a good place to start (hat tip to ever optimistic Harvard professor Steven Pinker). The site recently rounded up 20 of the happiest news stories of the first half of 2019 so you can head into the summer on a happier, more hopeful note. Here\\'s a sampling:\\n\\n1. Terrorism is on the decline.\\n\\nThe world sometimes seems like a terrifying place, but the good news is that one of the most feared types of violence, terrorism, is actually undergoing a sharp decline.\\n\\n\"Worldwide terrorist attacks fell by 33 per cent in 2018 compared to 2017, to the lowest level since 2011, a report released in January showed,\" reports Positive News. The positive numbers are largely driven by developments in the Middle East, such as the fall of Islamic State. Attacks by the group are down 71 percent.\\n\\n2. Scientists learned to spot Alzheimer\\'s years earlier.\\n\\nSadly, I can\\'t report that doctors have found a cure for the disease, but this year they took a huge step closer to being able to treat those affected.\\n\\n\"Years before symptoms of Alzheimer\\'s disease manifest, the brain starts changing and neurons are slowly degraded. In January, scientists from the German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases, the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research and the University Hospital Tübingen published a study that suggests a protein found in the blood can be used to precisely monitor disease progression long before the first clinical signs,\" notes Positive News. \"It offers new possibilities for testing therapies.\"\\n\\n3. A Galapagos tortoise isn\\'t extinct after all.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a terrifying year in environmental news, with one U.N. report warning that as many as a million species are threatened with extinction thanks to the impact of humans. But there have been spots of joy as well, such as scientists in the Galapagos islands spotting a female member of a tortoise species believed to have been extinct since 1906.\\n\\n\"The discovery of tracks and feces lead investigators to think there may be more members of the species on the island,\" adds Positive News.\\n\\n4. The earth is getting greener.\\n\\nEven planting a trillion trees won\\'t save us from climate change, according to one new study, but a greener, leafier earth will certainly be healthier and more pleasant. It\\'s even likely to make us humans happier, according to a raft of research. Humans seem to have gotten the message.\\n\\n\"The world is five per cent greener now than it was two decades ago, according to a study by Nasa. The US space agency claims that leaf cover on Earth has increased by two million square miles since the early 2000s, which is roughly equivalent to the area covered by the Amazon rainforest,\" Positive News happily reports.\\n\\n5. Scientists got a step closer to curing diabetes.\\n\\n\"In a first, scientists have turned human stem cells into insulin-producing cells, raising hope for a cure for type 1 diabetes. Experts at the University of California San Francisco say they have created healthy, functioning beta cells in a Petri dish,\" says Positive News.\\n\\n\"This is a critical step towards our goal of creating cells that could be transplanted into patients with diabetes,\" commented Matthias Hebrok, director of the UCSF Diabetes Center.'}, {'title': 'Trump’s 2019 and George Orwell’s ‘1984’ have too much in common', 'body': 'Text Size: A- A+\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 Share\\n\\nGeorge Orwell’s “1984” is the greatest fictional account of authoritarian leadership — the most astute, the most precise, the most attuned to human psychology.\\n\\nOne of its defining chapters explores the Two Minutes Hate, which helps establish and maintain Big Brother’s regime.\\n\\nAs Orwell describes it, the Hate begins with a flash of a face on a large screen. It is Emmanuel Goldstein, “the Enemy of the People.” His is “a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable,” and also unmistakably foreign. It produces fear and disgust.\\n\\nGoldstein defines disloyalty to the nation and (what is the same thing) the regime: “He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party’s purity.” Goldstein is responsible for heresies and treacheries of all kinds. He does not love his country.\\n\\nIn the first 30 seconds of the Hate, Goldstein’s voice is heard as he denounces the party and calls for freedom of multiple kinds. “He was abusing Big Brother,” and “he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought.”\\n\\nThe result is to produce rage and fear in the audience, and to do so immediately. Goldstein is a serious threat. Wherever he is, he commands a kind of shadow army, a network of conspirators. He is the author of a terrible book, including all the heresies.\\n\\nIn the second minute of the Hate, people become frenzied. They leap and shout, trying to drown out Goldstein’s maddening voice. Children join in the shouting.\\n\\nOrwell’s hero, Winston, finds himself unable to resist. He, too, begins to shout, and also to kick violently. On his part, this was no mere show. “The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part,” Orwell writes, “but that it was impossible to avoid joining in.”\\n\\nNo pretense was necessary: “A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledgehammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.”\\n\\nDespite loathing Big Brother, Winston felt his feelings “changed into adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock” against threats. And as his hatred mounts, it turns sexual. Winston fantasizes about raping and murdering the girl behind him.\\n\\nAt that point, the Hate rises to its climax. Goldstein’s voice becomes that of an actual bleating sheep, and for a moment, his face is transformed into that of a sheep. Big Brother’s face then fills the screen, powerful, comforting, and mysteriously calm.\\n\\nBig Brother’s actual words are not heard, but they are felt, as a kind of reassurance. At that point the Party’s three slogans appear on the screen:\\n\\nWAR IS PEACE\\n\\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\\n\\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\\n\\nA member of the audience seems to pray to Big Brother. For 30 seconds the audience chants in his honor, in “an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.” Winston chants with the rest, for “it was impossible to do otherwise.”\\n\\nThe Two Minutes Hate is a distillation of a common tactic of certain leaders, mostly in authoritarian nations, but in democracies as well. They focus attention on enemies, outsiders, foreigners and heretics — on those who seek to destroy society’s fabric.\\n\\nWhat makes the Two Minutes Hate so insidious is that even for those who oppose it, and see it for what it is, it tends to get under the skin. The sheer repetition of an accusation — against Emmanuel Goldstein, Hillary Clinton, Ilhan Omar, Muslims, immigrants or the press — can make it difficult not to feel, in some part of one’s mind, that the accusation is correct.\\n\\nActually it’s even worse.\\n\\nAs Orwell depicts it, the Hate liberates something in the human soul. It is not as if the relevant emotions — “fear and vindictiveness” — are unrecognizable, even to those who thought they had no animus against Goldstein. By unleashing “a hideous ecstasy,” embodied in chants of various kinds, authoritarian leaders aim to obliterate one thing above all: what Abraham Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature.” – Bloomberg\\n\\nAlso read: Global Pulse: The ‘blurred’ lines between yes & no, free speech & hate speech, & Trump’s separate realities\\n\\nWant to hear experts engage over the big issues of the day?

This is first high-level trip by a Pakistani prime minster to the White House during the Trump administration.\\n\\n“Pakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups, and successive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even supported some of these as proxies in Islamabad’s historical conflicts with its neighbors,” the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in a latest report on Pakistan.\\n\\nThe CRS is an independent and bipartisan research wing of the the US Congress, which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest for lawmakers to make informed decisions. Its reports are prepared by eminent experts of the field and are not considered as an official view of the Congress.\\n\\nThe latest CRS report told lawmakers that the 2011 revelation that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had enjoyed years-long refuge in Pakistan led to intensive US government scrutiny of the bilateral relationship. It also sparked congressional questioning of the wisdom of providing significant aid to a nation that may not have the intention or capacity to be an effective partner.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has taken a harder line on Pakistan than its predecessors, sharply cutting assistance and suspending security-related aid, said the CRS report dated July 15.\\n\\n“The United States continues to press for decisive and irreversible action against externally-focused militant groups and UN-designated terrorist organizations operating from its territory,” it said. “Pending such action, security assistance will remain suspended.”\\n\\nDuring a September 2018 visit to Islamabad amidst talk of a “reset” of bilateral ties, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed hope that the US could find common ground with Pakistan’s new leadership, but mutual distrust was seen to be pervasive in the relationship and American leverage was much reduced.\\n\\nIn mid-2017, the administration announced that it would “pause” disbursement of USD 255 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and announced a broader security aid suspension in January 2018. According to the State Department, about USD 790 million in unobligated FMF dating back to 2001 is affected.\\n\\nPakistani politicians and analysts of all stripes decried what they perceived as an effort to scapegoat their country for US policy failures in Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe administration’s 2020 budget request for assistance to Pakistan totals about USD 70 million, including USD 48 million for economic and development aid.\\n\\nNoting that numerous indigenous terrorist groups operate on or from Pakistani territory, many designated as ‘Foreign Terrorist Organisations’ under the US law, the CRS said incidents of domestic terrorism decreased since the Pakistan Army launched major operations in 2014.\\n\\nHowever, some externally-oriented terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba continue to operate, by some accounts supported by state elements. Al Qaeda and Islamic State networks are also present in Pakistan, it said.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Pakistan’s continued conflict and rivalry with India is unabated, with international fears about the possibility of war between two nuclear-armed powers.\\n\\nPakistan, it said, seeks to raise the issue of Kashmiri rights internationally, while India rejects any high-level peace negotiations pending decisive Pakistani action against anti-India militants inside Pakistan.\\n\\nThe report also notes that the Trump administration had noted Pakistan’s growing debt to China and expressed opposition to any bailout that would go to reducing such debt.\\n\\nPakistan’s Finance Ministry denies that the IMF funds would be used to repay Chinese debt and it is seeking to renegotiate aspects of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to reduce long-term debt, the CRS said.\\n\\nAlso read: Imran Khan’s US visit is for home audience.

He argues against some of the points raised by former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan recently against foreign currency-denominated sovereign bonds. He concedes, however, that Rajan’s first argument that small amounts of foreign currency-denominated sovereign bonds will not create a credible Indian sovereign yield curve is correct.\\n\\nHe criticises Rajan’s second argument that any such issuance “would hinder the internationalisation of the rupee”. The author writes this is anyway just a hope for some time to come as even the Yuan is facing challenges in attaining such a status.\\n\\nOn Rajan’s third argument that policymakers might go on a bond-issuing binge, he writes this is just “pure speculation”.\\n\\nRajan’s fourth argument was that since India can relax the cap on Foreign Portfolio Investments (FPIs), which will bring more investments into rupee bonds, thus, there is no point in issuing foreign currency-denominated bonds.\\n\\nAgainst this, the author argues that the benefit of foreign currency bonds will be that “Indian sovereign risk would be priced with lower liquidity/risk premia”.\\n\\nPrabhash Ranjan | The writer teaches at the faculty of legal studies, South Asian University\\n\\nHindustan Times\\n\\nRanjan outlines and explains some of the pronouncements of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. He writes India had claimed that Pakistan violated its obligations under Article 36 of Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). Under this, Jadhav had the right to consular officers of his state and Pakistan was obliged to inform the Indian consular post about Jadhav’s arrest.\\n\\nThe author mentions the ICJ concluded that Pakistan had violated Article 36 of the VCCR. It also rejected Pakistan’s claim that the issue of consular access between the two states was governed by their 2008 treaty and not VCCR.\\n\\nHowever, the author also writes India had asked the ICJ “to direct Pakistan to release Jadhav and to facilitate his safe passage to India”. On this, the ICJ stated that its jurisdiction was restricted to only interpreting and applying VCCR. Simultaneously though, the ICJ has asked Pakistan “to undertake an effective review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav”.\\n\\nShaji Vikraman | The writer is consulting editor, The Indian Express\\n\\nThe Indian Express\\n\\nVikraman argues that despite economic reforms, the political philosophy of Indira Gandhi on banking — that it is “a commercial enterprise driven by a larger social purpose and political considerations” — has remained unchanged. Regardless of the political ideology of the party at the Centre, there has been remarkable consensus on this front, which ignores the fact that the fundamental obligation of banks is to depositors, says Vikraman.\\n\\nHe writes this political philosophy has created huge fiscal costs and also posed a risk to our financial stability. To reinforce his point, he cites certain financial indicators of our public banking system.\\n\\nHe argues one of the consequences of this situation is the unwillingness of banks to reduce lending rates sharply even though the RBI has cut interest rates by 75 bps this year.\\n\\nHe concludes by saying that the banking model resting on political considerations and ownership control now needs to be undone.\\n\\nSujan R Chinoy | Director General, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, New Delhi\\n\\nThe Hindu\\n\\nChinoy discusses how the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of 57 states, repeatedly expresses concern over the situation of Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir, but overlooks China’s alleged human rights violations of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang province. He cites that the recent Abu Dhabi OIC declaration, or even the previous Dhaka declaration, “made no reference to China or its Muslim minorities”. In fact, he mentions, that one resolution passed at Abu Dhabi actually hailed China’s efforts in taking care of its Muslim citizens. This despite the fact that a UN committee and Human Rights Watch have both criticised China for its actions.\\n\\nHe suggests that the reasons for this OIC stance are that China is a major power with a permanent UNSC seat, is “a large market for hydrocarbons” and is also a “source of arms and investments”. Countries that are under any kind of US pressure, or require sanctions relief, often turn to China. In return, they guard its interests at the OIC, writes Chinoy.\\n\\nSudipto Mundle | Distinguished fellow, National Council of Applied Economic Research\\n\\nMint\\n\\nThe BJP, which got a huge electoral mandate, has lost the opportunity to present a game-changing budget. Mundle writes that while most of the Budget work must have been done by the time Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman took charge and notwithstanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s penchant for game-changing schemes, the North Block mandarins have given us a largely incremental and pedestrian Budget.\\n\\nFiscal deficit was contained due to expenditure compression. Revenue expenditure grew by 6.9 per cent in 2018-19, down from 11.1 per cent a year ago. The continuing reversal of hard-won tariff reforms was disappointing.\\n\\nThe Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme (PM-Kisan) — income support of Rs 6,000 per year for farmers — is an important beginning. Building on this programme, India could move towards an unconditional universal income transfer scheme.\\n\\nMihir Shah | Co-founder, Samaj Pragati Sahayog\\n\\nBusiness Standard\\n\\nInter-state conflicts over sharing of river water have become endemic in India, despite decades of effort at resolving them, says Shah. It is a national shame, reflecting a symptom of faulty approach to water management.\\n\\nNew York residents pay those in the city’s watersheds for the eco-system service they provide by protecting catchment areas and keeping river basins clean.\\n\\nMGNREGA needs to be recast on a watershed basis and use its enormous resources for river rejuvenation and water harvesting. Urban planners need to keep in mind that destructive land use and land encroachment will impact sustainability and quality of water sources.\\n\\nAccording to Shah, the only solution to the Kaveri conflict for example is to ensure that all stakeholders come together to find a solution. Each river basin is a shared resource and its health will determine the future.\\n\\nHarsh V Pant | Professor, international relations, Department of Defence Studies, King’s College London\\n\\nThe Economic Times\\n\\nPant, in his column, writes Pakistan is visibly under pressure. It agreed to many of the Indian demands pertaining to the Kartarpur corridor negotiations, re-opening its airspace to Indian planes followed by Pakistan’s Punjab province registering FIRs against Hafiz Saeed and his accomplices. Its isolation was also clear when the ICJ ruled in favour of India in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.\\n\\nThe Modi government, in its first term, faced flak for not having a ‘Pakistan policy’, but not only was there a sustained policy, it was part of a broader foreign policy.\\n\\nPakistan is now showing its keenness to reopen dialogue with India. “How Pakistan deals with Jadhav’s case after the ICJ verdict will be an important test case for Islamabad’s commitment to seeking normalisation of ties with New Delhi,” he says.\\n\\nWant to hear experts engage over the big issues of the day?

The deadline for chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to prove majority is 1:30pm, and newspapers are counting down the minutes.\\n\\nThe deadline was decided upon by governor Vajubhai Vala, who “stepped in” since “proceedings in the Karnataka assembly” descended to “chaos”, writes The Indian Express in “Governor sets a deadline as Karnataka vote goes into limbo”. Speaker K.R. Kumar remained undecided on the resignations of the rebel MLAs.\\n\\nHindustan Times writes that the governor is “likely setting up another political showdown before the final word is heard on the fate of the 15-month-old coalition government”. The Times of India calls it “a dramatic twist” of events, and The Hindu says the governor’s intervention “came as a shock” for the coalition government, which it says is “13 months” old.\\n\\nWhile The Hindu states that the governor’s direction came after the “House adjourned earlier on Thursday amid a heated debate without a vote on the confidence motion moved by the Chief Minister”, TOI says the “missives overshadowed the trust vote moved by Kumaraswamy on a day when Congress’s strength in the House shrunk by two more MLAs”.\\n\\nHT says the governor “acted upon” the request of “exasperated” BJP members, who requested the vote be wound up after “three adjournments amid acrimonious verbal exchanges and repeated disruptions by slogan-chanting Congress members”.\\n\\n“In the night, the entire BJP Legislature Party, led by Leader of the Opposition B.S. Yeddyurappa, slept in the Assembly, protesting against the delay in the motion being put to vote,” informs The Hindu.\\n\\nJadhav release\\n\\nAlso making news is “After India calls for action on ICJ order, Pak says will grant consular access” (Express). The daily writes that it was only “hours after New Delhi asked Islamabad to ‘immediately’ grant consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav” that they complied.\\n\\nHT writes that “external affairs minister S Jaishankar said Jadhav was innocent of the charges levelled against him and a forced confession without legal representation and due process wouldn’t change this fact.”\\n\\nThe Hindu writes, “Mr. Jaishankar described the verdict as a vindication of India’s position and a reiteration of the rule of law.”\\n\\nTOI informs that the “modalities were being worked out” for Jadhav’s consular access.\\n\\nAyodhya verdict\\n\\nThe Hindu’s second lead informs “SC to hear Ayodhya title dispute cases from Aug. 2”.\\n\\n“The order came after the court perused a progress report filed by the committee earlier this week,” it informs.\\n\\nTOI gives it less than column space on page 1, saying that the court is “allowing the mediation panel to continue negotiations till July 31”. HT gives it column space, while the Express drops it entirely.\\n\\nMuzaffarnagar riots and others\\n\\nThe Express runs an exclusive report which finds “glaring holes” in Uttar Pradesh’s prosecution of “10 murder cases filed on the violence that swept through Muzaffarnagar in 2013, killing at least 65 people”. Its headline is disturbing: “In 40 of 41 Muzaffarnagar riot cases, including murder, all accused are acquitted”.\\n\\nIt found that the “courts acquitted all in the 10 murder trials that ended between January 2017 and February 2018”.\\n\\nOn its front page flap, HT carries “Trade point planned at India-China LAC” which finds no mention in the other papers. It writes, “The Indian Army has approved the opening of a new trading point with China… along India’s disputed, albeit peaceful 3,488-km border with China in a confidence building measure ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s October visit.”\\n\\nOpinion\\n\\nIn “NRC quagmire”, TOI argues that considering the Assam National Register of Citizens is rife with so many errors and corruption charges that it is perhaps not prudent to perform this exercise again in West Bengal.\\n\\nThe Centre and state governments have asked for an extension from the Supreme Court to publish the final list.\\n\\nUpdating the NRC list in Assam requires people to “produce documentation which links them to a legacy database that ends with electoral rolls up to March 24, 1971”. This has proven to be difficult for many since millions of Indians still don’t have proper identification documents. The NRC has also vested immense power in petty bureaucracy and quasi-judicial bodies where “abuse of power was inevitable.” Further, the fate of those who will not make it to the list also remains uncertain, writes TOI.\\n\\nIn “After Vindication”, Express highlights the circumstances of the verdict in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case by the International Court of Justice and what will follow after it. “The ICJ called on Pakistan to take a fresh look at Jadhav’s case, immediately restore his legal rights and provide India consular access,” it says. The court also ruled that Pakistan violated the Vienna conventions by failing to inform “Jadhav of his legal rights and immediately intimate the Indian embassy about his detention”.\\n\\nIn a strange but expected fashion, Pakistan’s official reaction is to “claim victory” over the verdict, writes Express. However, while India may have won on the international legal turf, “the task of persuading Pakistan to respect the ICJ ruling will not be easy”. Along with using all available legal means it will also require to have a quiet conversation with Pakistan “to encourage it to do the right thing”, it writes.\\n\\nPrime Time\\n\\nPrime Time debates were split between Ishrat Jahan attending a Hindu religious event in a hijab, the wobbly Karnataka assembly, and more unusually, the issue of minimum wage.\\n\\nAaj Tak: On ‘#HallaBol’, anchor Anjana Om Kashyap discussed BJP leader Ishrat Jahan getting heckled for wearing a hijab while attending a Hindu event.\\n\\nBJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia blamed the state government saying, “The entire nation stands by Ishrat Jahan… It is deplorable that the government of West Bengal has been unable to secure Jahan and her children.”\\n\\nPolitical analyst Manojit Mandal defended the state, “Action is being taken against those people. We are giving her assurance that there is no need to be scared. There is law and order in this Bengal.”\\n\\nTimes Now, too, discussed Jahan’s ordeal. The question anchor Padmaja Joshi posed was — “Can ‘tolerance’ be selective?”\\n\\nIslamic scholar Ilyas Sharafuddin said, “No one should hound or intimidate any lady”, but added, “When she claims to be a Muslim, by worshipping the creations and not the creator, Allah, she is breaking the basic rules of Islam.”\\n\\nLawyer Mahmood Paracha said, “Ishrat Jahan should be provided with security. It is the basic concept of freedom of choice in India.”\\n\\nZafar Sareshwala, chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University, argued, “It is her (Ishrat Jahan) sole business whether she is going anywhere with or without hijab and it is highly unacceptable to hound a lady in this way.”\\n\\nABP News: The shootout in Sonebadhra in Uttar Pradesh which saw 10 deaths and 24 arrests, became the topic of debate. Anchor Romana Isar Khan asked the panel if the police feels handicapped in front of goons in UP.\\n\\nPolitical analyst Nishant Verma and BJP spokesperson Shalmani Tripathi had a spat over the state’s law and order situation. “The police is meant for law and order, not revenge,” said Verma.\\n\\nTripathi then accused Verma of being an “ideological goonda,” adding that it was only after Yogi Adityanath took over as chief minister that “the police was given the freedom to fight back against goons”.\\n\\nCNN News: Zakka Jacob discussed the ongoing breakdown of the Congress-JD(S) alliance in Karnataka. BJP MLAs led by B.S. Yeddyurappa refused to leave the assembly premises Thursday stayed the night there.\\n\\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi, counsel for the speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar, said, “It is not the Speaker who decides the trust vote in that sense… The decision really is as much of the governmental bodies as well.”\\n\\nBJP spokesperson Amit Malviya argued that the Speaker was in no way looking to expedite the process. “If he had wanted 26 people to speak, the assembly proceedings could have continued. We saw the Congress and JD(S) members creating a ruckus,” Malviya said.\\n\\nNDTV 24×7: With the government opting for a Rs 2 hike in minimum wage, Sreenivasan Jain dissected the labour code.\\n\\nBJP’s Lalitha Kumaramangalam said, “Implementing a minimum wage is a problem for land owners who are dead against increasing the minimum wage. The economic survey said that whatever the minimum wage is, it must be implementable.”\\n\\nJain countered her. “We’re losing sight of the fact that 90% of this county is already paying above the minimum wage.”\\n\\nActivist Akriti Bhatia, called the move “anti-labour”.\\n\\n“We talk about a $5 trillion economy, but how will we create any purchasing power when one person can’t even have a meal in a day. It is an extremely sorry state that we have reached today,” she said.\\n\\nWith inputs from Rachel John.\\n\\nWant to hear experts engage over the big issues of the day?
